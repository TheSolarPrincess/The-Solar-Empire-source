This is the source code of my website, [[https://thesolarprincess.site/][The Solar Empire]]. It‘s for my personal use, but if you want to fork it and make your own website, go ahead.

** Raison d'être

- Some pages on this site have an English and a Russian language version – I needed to generate language-switch links in the header
- This generates RSS on my own terms (the files I want to generate RSS for, and the time of publishing, are under my control). Two versions of the RSS – Russian and English feeds.


** How to

Change the project-base variable in code.el to where you put the files. Or replace it with just getting the current directory; I don‘t do this for clandestine reasons.
Run code.el to export everything into the out/ folder, which can be served from a static website host.

RSS generation works with Babashka, you‘d have to install it if you want RSS.
