&lt;p&gt;
John is an astronomer. A really awesome astronomer — he knows everything about stars, planets, zodiacs, and whatever else astronomers know (I’m not an astronomologist). If you need to calculate the distance to a star, figure out how to build a plane that works on Mars, or process telescope data to find habitable planets — he’s the guy you’d mean when you say “I know a guy”. Oh, and John lives in 2005, before Pluto was reclassified as not a planet.&lt;br&gt;
He’s writing a book about the planets in the Solar System, comparing their statistics. In the chapter on planet sizes, he writes: “The smallest planet in the Solar System is about 2400 kilometers in diameter,” meaning Pluto.&lt;br&gt;
Another astronomer, Jack, finds this book in 2010. He reads the sentence: “The smallest planet in the Solar System is about 2400 kilometers in diameter.” Jack knows Pluto isn’t a planet, so he believes the smallest planet in the Solar System is Mercury, with a diameter of about 4900 kilometers. He reads it and thinks: “The smallest planet in the Solar System is 4900 kilometers across. But John writes that the smallest planet in the Solar System is 2400 kilometers in diameter. That’s a huge discrepancy! He tried to measure a planet and got it wrong by almost a factor of two! Clearly John is a terrible astronomer if he can’t even get the size of a planet right.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yet John is actually an excellent astronomer. He only got one rather unimportant classification wrong. The reasoning “The smallest planet is Mercury, and John thinks the smallest planet is 2400 kilometers in diameter, therefore John thinks Mercury is 2400 kilometers in diameter” is not as logically valid an inference as it sounds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
…Okay, why is this seemingly trivial bit written here? As it turns out, for many people this reasoning isn’t nearly as obvious as it is to me. After hearing conclusions of this kind for the hundrendth time, on the hundred and first I’d rather just write a standard response on my blog and link to it from now on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A long time ago, in a server far far away, I had an argument about a thing I wanted to write about in a blog post. I‘m going to take this opportunity to actually talk about it publicly, because those guys are the perfect foils to bounce my opinion off of. Everything is very heavily edited and anonymised to make it clear that it‘s not me using this website as a makeshift shower to argue in, but a Galileo Galilei style Salviati/Sagredo/Simplicio essay that also happens to be a true story.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-waiting&lt;/b&gt;, supporting the Princess&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: two techbro foils, a physicist and a programmer&lt;br&gt;
Various &lt;b&gt;Pawns&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a18bfb"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It all started with a simple question. I'm a Discordian - what does that mean?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: So Discordianism is not something you made up as a meme?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Unfortunately no, lol, it‘s so fucked. It‘s like when video games need an ideology to explain why the jerk faction exists.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Discordianism is cringe not because it’s bullshit, but because it’s not bullshit enough. Pastatfarianism is as bullshit as they can get away with, and that makes it fun. Discordianism is just eh?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: The cringe is that Discordianism is not a parody. It‘s unironic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Aaaaaaaaaa! &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality"&gt;Bacon-Necktie&lt;/a&gt; is a more sensible morality axis than this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Discordianism‘s morality axis is order-disorder, which in fairly mainstream.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I present a thematic excerpt from &lt;a href="https://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/1.php"&gt;Principia Discordia&lt;/a&gt;, the main text of Discordianism, on the „axis“:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;HERE FOLLOWS SOME PSYCHO-METAPHYSICS.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are not hot for philosophy, best just to skip it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper that is the level of distinction making.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With our concept making apparatus called "mind" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The ideas-about- reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see "reality" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper that is the level of concept.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ORDER is in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the ERISTIC ILLUSION.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reality is the original Rorschach.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#x00ad; &lt;a href="https://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/56.php"&gt;Principia Discordia, p 00056&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thus began the whole conversation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: The whole point is to find a such a grid such that everything that is not in the grid is either false or useless. Nobody cares about capital-T Truth. Solving physics and finding the Theory of Everything would be cool, but computationally difficult&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Pshysical “Theory of Everything” is also just a grid and not the capital-T Truth. We‘re not talking about physical experiments here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: It's not a grid, it's THE grid. There isn‘t anything notable in its sub-grids. Any model reaches a point where it‘s pointless to dig deeper.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Don‘t confuse models and reality. The Theory of Everything is a model, and, frankly, it‘s not even that useful for most cases.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tweedledee defends the position of “Western philosophy”, searching for the ultimate grid that can explain all of reality. And he equates such a grid with the pshysical Theory of Everything – a theory that can predict the outcome of any physical experiment. In other words, he directly asserts the Aneristic illusion, which makes him the perfect foil.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: The physical Theory of Everything is not the Capital-T Truth. It's just a model of physics. If I give you the ultimate field equation now, that wouldn‘t help you predicting what I say next. In practice, you‘d use other models, other grids. You won‘t ever reduce everything to the ToE; likely the best use you, personally, would have for this equation is to put it on a tattoo. The fact that a model that predicts the outcome of any physical experiment is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear „Capital T truth“ is Aneristic Illusion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Do you think the human brain is nondeterministic? With ToE and enough compute/data, it is totally possible to predict what a person would say&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You won't ever have enough compute/data. If we now get this theory of everything, it will be a symbolic victory, and then we will shrug our shoulders and interact with reality through other models&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: They are not unsolvable on some basic universal level. They are as unsolvable for us as modern science is for a Mesopotamian.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: What do you know about the basic universal level?!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I know that we have one problem left – befriending gravity with the rest of the flock&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Is it like when Niels Bohr, when he decided to go into physics, was told that there was no point, physics was already over?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: It‘s not going to be like that, we‘re already at the smallest energy scales, there just isn‘t anything lower&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: That's similar to what they said to Bohr&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: „Back then“ was before we built CERN and studied the microwave background&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: And now is „back then“ before the next major achievement&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: You don‘t seem to understand the current state of science. We‘re already at the pshysical limits of energy at a point.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I understand it quite well. But we may still find out that it‘s not even about energy at a point.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: If it‘s not about energy, then we won‘t even be able to observe it, and therefore we don‘t care.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, how is treating Theory of Everything as &lt;b&gt;The&lt;/b&gt; grid problematic?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures"&gt;The Two Cultures&lt;/a&gt; is a famous lecture that contrasts how tech and humanities conceptualize studying the universe. Techies see a large universe, in which humans are a special case; they may be interesting in many ways, but insignificant on the universal scale, being limited to the surface of one planet. Humanities see a variety of human activities, among which studying the physical laws beyond our planet is a special case; it may be interesting in many ways, but irrelevant in most people‘s actual lives. The author sees the widening rift between these two cultures as a serious problem, limiting our ability to understand the world.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tweedledee is the exreme “techie” - he wants to reduce all questions of the structure of the world to physics, and considers the complete theory of physics, capable of predicting the outcomes of any experiment, to be the pinnacle of understanding. Human behavior is a special case of a physical experiment, reducible to physical processes in the brain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The issue with this picture is that it is correct. If you know the positions of all particles and forces acting on them and all the physical laws underlying it, then you can calculate everything that happens in the brain and precisely predict people's behavior. Not literally &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, of course – you don‘t know the laws, and even if you did, all this data won‘t fit into your brain – but &lt;i&gt;in theory&lt;/i&gt;! Even if some kind of non-epiphenomenal „soul“ exists, that can influence your behaviour, you can just include it into the law. Anyone who knows physics would see that as obvious and undeniable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But this idea is only true because it‘s almost tautological. It doesn‘t really constrain expectations much. It doesn't really clarify more than „reality exists and follows rules“. But since this map is ostensibly very close to the territory and contains &lt;i&gt;literally everything&lt;/i&gt;, it tends to instill a completely uncalled-for confidence in your own understanding. When your map is seen to be this close to the territory, your capacity to distinguish the map from the territory atrophies, and you just take all your beliefs as if they were reality. The techbro &lt;i&gt;nominally&lt;/i&gt; admits that yes, humans are flawed and biased, and yes, our intelligence is limited by the compute of our brains, and yes, we see reality only through the lens of our perception. But he does not have it in his bones, he doesn‘t see every thought his brains tells him  as having come through an imperfect lens, and he has no mental toolset that lets him model the distortions and correct for them. The archetypical techbro error is “I know this one thing, so I know everything.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Without deep intuitive understanding of the map/territory distinction, “anything is reducible to physics” feels equivalent to “my understanding of anything is reducible to my understanding of physics.” The first is a territory-statement, the second is a map-statement, but the techbro underestimates the enourmousness of the gap between those.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="org8558212"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/psychometaphysics/physicists.png" alt="physicists.png" width="300px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A lot of arguments between tech and humanities end up looking the same. One talks about the map, the other talks about the territory, and neither understands the other. Any criticism of &lt;i&gt;human understanding&lt;/i&gt; of a physical law is seen as a criticism of the physical law itself. Criticizing the &lt;i&gt;idea&lt;/i&gt; of reducing everything to physics feels same as criticism of the &lt;i&gt;fact&lt;/i&gt; that everything can be reduced to physics. And since the reducibility of all observed phenomena to physics is beyond doubt, tech sees humanities as idiots.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Do you think that in the foreseeable future the time will come for physics to perfectly explain everything? My normie common sense tells me that it‘s very unlikely.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I'm pretty sure yes. The problem isn‘t even lack of data, we just have a mathematical analysis paralysis about combining the theories&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Okay, let's say this is true, and we‘ll end physics at observable energy levels. But then the ToE won‘t be the capital-T Truth,  but an approximation up to the point where we in practice don‘t care about digging deeper?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Don‘t you think that maybe the model will be pretty accurate but not perfect? In Newton‘s time nobody even knew that measurement limits exist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Was it Feynman who said that when we find the ToE, physics will only really begin?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: It will be perfect in every practical sense. We have found all the fundamental forces and their limits. The only thing left is to round up the math. That‘s where physics ends by definition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Maybe we don‘t know about something deeper that is yet undiscovered but important? There almost certainly is something. Newton couldn‘t know about quantum gravity. I think it‘s reasonable to assume that the end of physics won‘t happen this time, just like it didn‘t happen the last time we thought it was coming.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: You are trying to peek behind the veil of Maya and see the Truth and not the Tree. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But you already see the outlines of the Tree, and this makes you uneasy. Y‘all really don‘t understand fundamental physics. On every known level of abstraction, we already know the most fundamental component, except gravity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Are you certain that there aren‘t any deeper levels that we haven‘t thought about? We crack gravity, and open some other Pandora‘s Box, just like it happened every time in the history of physics?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: There could be an invisible, intangible, inaudible pink unicorn in the room, but why do I give a damn? Even if the box opens, it would at worst contain operations on known energies. Thank God gravity doesn‘t produce any particles and can only operate on the existing ones. And we already know that those particles don‘t do anything wonky.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Once upon a time, no one knew about quantum mechanics, and we all thought that tiny billiard balls won‘t do anything wonky either.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: The current situation is so far away from that conceptually, that, just lol&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Humanities study, among other things, how ideas develop, spread and change. Empiricism, theism, socialism, reductionism, impressionism, modernism, and other “isms” are all ideas. Questions like „why was Aristotelian thought so dominant for so long in Europe, before falling out of fashion“ are in the domain of humanities. History is full of ideas that seemed true to certain people at certain times, even though now we know them to be wrong. Why did so many people take fascism seriously back in the day? Were they all morons?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea that everything can be reduced to physics is also an “ism,” specifically physicalism. This is also an idea that arose, spread, and evolved. Just like any other ism, it has cultural assumptions, a philosophical basis, historical vestiges and implicit assumptions. And when people think with that idea, they display the universal human irrationality in the same way as with any other ism. If you are not familiar with what humanities say about your ism, if you do not know how people form ideas, and what forms your perception of reality, it‘s very easy to slip into thinking that this one idea is just the raw reality, not noticing all the personal idiosyncratic baggage you bring with it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="orge0d22d6"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/psychometaphysics/hanson.png" alt="hanson.png" width="500px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To understand the universe, you need to understand humans, because a human is the one doing the understanding. To understand the territory, it is necessary to understand maps, because you can only see territory through maps.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: No, you need ToE, I‘ve explained why. Working with physics without ToE is like working with math without knowing all the axioms. It‘s possible, but eh&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Errr&amp;#x2026; Are you also trying to find some kind of universal ur-set of axioms that is applicable in all situations?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: WDYM „trying” - it’s definitely possible&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_program"&gt;No&lt;/a&gt;. It was a clever attempt, but in the end it turned out to be impossible&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Fuck the incompleteness theorem in this case. We analyze reality, the ultimate judge. You don‘t need to make your system a thing-in-itself, you are describing what actually exists. Is it possible to construct a system of axioms that would describe itself? No, this is obvious fucking nonsense , you need an external system to build it inside of. Is it possible to construct a system of axioms that describe a given model? Yes, of course. We have a model, we just don’t know what all the axioms are. It‘s awfully simple - you‘re given a program and you need to study it and provide an exact copy. But they don‘t care about the code, but only about the executable. So you don‘t have to recreate the code. You just need to write code that is identical post-compiling. That‘s fucking it. It‘s difficult. Hellishly difficult. But not impossible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: By the way, I wouldn’t be very surprised if in the end it turns out that our universe is capable of some kind of hypercomputation, but our merely Turing-complete brains can‘t conceptualize it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Highly doubtful. There have to be some really fucking special boundary conditions. And then everything just breaks. Including conservation laws. And those seem to be woven into the very essence of all interactions&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Have you noticed, by the way, that the law of conservation of energy already doesn‘t apply with the expanding universe?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Uh? What's this nonsense? The expansion of the universe does not generate energy. 100%.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240313090349/https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Yeah that's quantum gravity for you&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Not even quantum. We knew this since general relativity, since 1920&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Because it's an interaction between the expansion of the universe and energy quanta. From which, it would seem, the quantum nature of gravity should follow. But somehow not&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here I recall historical examples of the pitfalls of the idea of an “utimate grid”.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“Hilbert program” was an idea from a time when mathematicians were still young and innocent. Once the concepts of “axiom”, “theorem” and “proof” were formalized, an idea came to them – to constuct the ultimate set of axioms that covers all needs forever. The holy grail was a purely mechanical procedure that you can use to confirm or debunk any claim. The project ended when Kurt Gödel proved that it was impossible, which sent mathematicians of that time (and many still now) into an existential crisis. As my college pal told me, “mathematicians proved that mathematics does not work.” This, of course, is an overly dramatic misinterpretation of the discovery, but if one cannot decouple the map from the territory, if one intuitively works with mathematics and &lt;i&gt;their idea&lt;/i&gt; of ​​mathematics with the same mental tools, their brain short-curcuits &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.godel" class="footref" href="#fn.godel" role="doc-backlink"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The fact that energy conservation does not work in an expanding universe is now &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240313090349/https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/"&gt;a known fact&lt;/a&gt;, and it's no longer surprizing to physicists. But in the past it perplexed even Einstein – his intellectual skirmish with Emmy Noether was about her theorem wrt general relativity, and Noether turned out to be correct and earned &lt;a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/931822"&gt;some glowing praise&lt;/a&gt; from Einstein. Since Noether discovered the mathematical source of conservation laws, the correct response to "energy is not conserved in an expanding universe" should be “OK.” The theorem shows that what we call “energy” is an abstraction over time symmetry, and when this symmetry does not hold, energy does not have to be conserved. But to Tweedledee, like many who don't study physics too deep&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, "energy" still intuitively feels like some kind of objectively real entity, like a liquid flowing from object to object and causing them to move. Violating the law of conservation of energy seems like magic, a liquid appearing out of nowhere (“does not generate energy”). And even if you manually double-check all the calculations and make sure that yes, in this particular case enrgy is not conserved, it still feels like cheating. This feeling of perplexion is borne of confusing the map and the territory; the mere symbolic representation on the map seems like reality. When you look down at the ground and don't see the meridians.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org74b6682" class="outline-2"&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org74b6682"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tweedledum intervenes and raises the stakes. This time, scientific knowledge is seen as the only correct way to perceive reality, and everything that does not fit into it is compressed into one point on the map - “unfalsifiable magical religious pink unicorn bullshit.” Or, to put it simpler, the ultimate grid is now scientism rather than physicalism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: What does all this have to do with Discordianism?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Tweedledee annointed the physical Theory of Everything to be his favorite grid, I'm objecting to that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Discordianism makes an interesting statement: reality is unknowable. Which, in a sense, is the second question of philosophy. Which can, yes, be answered in different ways. But personally, I see the answer from reduction as the most correct: if reality is unknowable, what is the difference between this question and the first question of philosophy?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Fuck philosophy. Give me a sensible definition of an "unknowable" part of the universe. Unknowable part of the universe my ass&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Allah. Allah specifically is defined as unknowable. You are allowed to not believe in Islam. But if you believe in Islam, then you believe in something unknowable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: If your god is indistinguishable from statistical noise, then it is not a god, it's statistical noise. And they put it outside the universe, otherwise it'd be too obvious. So it's invalid. Unknowability is essentially non-interactivity. We need a thing that clearly obviously exists, but refuses any attempts to interact with it. Otherwise it's either not a part of this universe, or not unknowable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Yes. This is why I believe that ideologemes that answer “no” to the second question of philosophy are stupidly outdated. They are indistinguishable from religion. They require belief that their description of the indescribable is true.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: “Unknowable” in this case does not mean “there is no truth.” It means “you, you specifically, with your actual physical brain  as it is, won’t be able to know.” It's pragmatics. Let me remind you that the title is “​&lt;i&gt;psycho&lt;/i&gt;​metaphysics”. This is about the properties of humans and how they understand reality and interact with it. It's not a fundamental property of the universe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;:  The word "metaphysics" is equivalent to diving into shit with no right to resurface.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But in this dialogue you've been doing nothing but metaphysics the whole time; you're just allergic to the word.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I'm not searching for invisible pink unicorns; I'm directly asserting that they do not exist in the universe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: That's a conclusion reached within metaphysics by philosophers. In the past it wasn't obvious. Until people started doing metaphysics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;:  Yeah, and atheism is a religion, sure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Atheism is not a religion, but atheism as a phenomenon is studied within religious studies. Similarly, "A Theory of Everything may exist" is also from metaphysics; that too wasn't always obvious.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: "A Theory of Everything might exist" is a take as old as the first conscious observation. Because a Theory of Everything is just the idea: "hmm, I can explain this&amp;#x2026; what if everything can be explained, it's just hard". The fact that humanity needed 20,000+ years to even get to that thought is fucking cringe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: HA HA, NO. That was not obvious at all, not even close. Plenty of ancient people's beliefs look like absolute batshit cringe to us now. And we only find the idea obvious today because of the work of philosophers. And right now there's surely a ton of equally cringe beliefs — yours and mine — that people in the future will laugh their asses off at.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: A Theory of Everything is the moment when physicists, instead of answering "why" with "fuck if I know", answer it with "objectively don't give a shit".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The conversation shifted to criticizing religion. No point posting the whole thing — it’s just the standard Richard Dawkins / “New Atheist” takes. Even though I don’t believe in God and dislike organized religion, I’ve always felt a certain contempt for Reddit-tier atheistic arguments. If you know you know; if you don't, just trust me that &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/in-this-moment-i-am-euphoric"&gt;it’s all painfully bad&lt;/a&gt;. Without genuinely understanding the actual positions and thought processes of theists, if someone just sees them as “idiots who believe in fairy tales,” the atheist is wide open to making exactly the same mistakes — and the atheism in their head becomes another religion, only worse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At that point the Lady-in-Waiting jumped in, as our resident theist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Yet another iteration of petty performative edgelording. Reaching the exact same rock-bottom cringe level as [REDACTED], except [REDACTED] at least sincerely believes what they’re saying and just doesn’t know how to argue, whereas Tweedledee is deliberately acting like an asshole and for some reason thinks it’s cool.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: You know, if I’m a petty edgelord, then Muhammad – who wrote a whole fucking treatise on how to live, supposedly from an omnipotent being, in verse form, and whose life story is X-rated – he must be one of the greatest edgelords in human history. Me &amp;lt; … &amp;lt; Muhammad &amp;lt; Shadow the Hedgehog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: I barely follow your logic. And I think we have very different understanding of the term “edgelord.” I’m not against criticism of religion (though the passage above is peak r/atheism and forcing modern logic into the past is horribly cringe), I’m against this kind of performative rudeness and mockery. On this particular issue it ends up being the exact same “lol believers so dumb” as [REDACTED].&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Anyway, dropping some insider info for the Lady-in-Waiting: I actually have a fair bit of experience interacting with Orthodox Jews. And, well, I kinda get how they think. And I find it fucking hilarious. Seriously using a 2000+ year-old rulebook that has blatantly obvious scientific and moral fuck-ups is something only a complete moron would do. Since there aren’t that many of those, the rest reinterpret the 2000+ year-old fuck-ups in ways that don’t make themselves gag. I’m not saying all religious people are uneducated trash and atheism is a mark of the übermensch. I’m saying that in a head-to-head comparison of usefulness to humanity right now, the atheist is winning. Has been for about the last 100 years, give or take.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Let me tell you something fun. I first reached a set of ideas on my own (for my own reasons), that I was ready to defend on fairly rational grounds. They just happened to more or less line up with Buddhism. I only learned it much later, post-factum, when I researched Buddhism for a Buddhist character in a roleplay and discovered that my ideas aren‘t new and already have a name — they’d already been expressed by all those Buddhas and Bodhidharmas. Do you consider that “blindly following dogma without understanding”?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion anyway, but it’s all just a mess and I don’t give enough of a shit to sort out the details. The Bible clearly spells out a philosophy of cooperation, but it comes with a ton of caveats and that’s why it sucks. Buddhism is probably about the same, just in anime form.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: What exactly are the advantages of atheism over Zen Buddhism, lol?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Higher chance of generating the correct understanding of the world.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: How?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Run an experiment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Uh??? Buddhists can’t run experiments?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Buddhists never came up with it. It never occurred to anyone to test the theory, or at least notice that it’s absolutely unprovable. It never occurred to anyone that absolute unprovability is, on a very basic level, equivalent to falsity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You do realize Newton was deeply religious, right? Hell, the scientific method was invented by Francis Bacon — not an atheist in the slightest.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘More philosophy than religion’ is an interesting take with a very curious history. Allow me to give you a little historical background.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The word “religion,” when it first appeared in that form, implied using Christianity as the yardstick for all beliefs. And in the early days of European religious studies, Buddhism was indeed perceived as a variation on the same theme (we believe in Jesus, they believe in Buddha). There‘s been a lot of cultural exchange with Asia since then, and we realized there’s basically nothing in common here, and lumping the two phenomena under the same word makes about as much sense as putting apples, pears, oranges, and sea urchins into a single category “roundedible.” Yet due to cultural inertia we still project Christianity, Buddhism, shamanism, Aztec beliefs, and the cult of Dionysus onto the exact same mental map, and instinctively fill all the blank spots with our preconceptions about Abrahamic religions. Even when we invent a new religion for a fictional world, we still end up with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz6uO8baYKI"&gt;something that slots neatly into that same map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As ongoing cultural exchange continued, many Westerners noticed that meditation is actually good for mental health, and the radical humanism and compassion toward all living beings that the Buddha taught is, frankly, a pretty solid way to live your life. The idea of universal compassion isn’t new to the West – Jesus said that. But for secular atheists (and especially /r/atheism types), Jesus’ teaching had already been smeared by secular prejudices and shrunk to a single point on the map – “that thing only fundies believe” – and so it is reflexively rejected. Buddhism no longer fits that map very well; the pattern doesn’t complete, the thought-terminating cliché fails to activate, and the atheist is forced to look at it critically, unsqueeze that point on the map, and actually think again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="org84ba8d0"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/psychometaphysics/thingjapanen.png" alt="thingjapanen.png" width="400px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That ‘more philosophy than religion’ line is a kind of „separate magisteria“ of Western intellectuals: we want to practice this religion, it works, there are real benefits, but we don’t want to be on the same spot on the map. Buddhism has just as much unscientific baggage as Christianity does. Both are “philosophies,” and both include belief in the “supernatural.” Practicing either one yields mental-health benefits. But declaring yourself a “secular Buddhist” and keeping only the practice while tossing out the magic feels far less internally cringe than doing the exact same thing with Christianity. The collapse of the false category “religion” finally let people do what they could, in principle, have been doing all along since the dawn of enlightened atheism – they just never thought of it.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This brings me back to &lt;a href="../factsandlogic.html"&gt;my earlier idea of the literary genre of logic and rationality&lt;/a&gt;. Logic, rationality, science, atheism, and rejection of the supernatural are pretty nice. But on our internal &lt;i&gt;map&lt;/i&gt;, this slice of reality is drawn with certain symbolic legend that doesn’t necessarily correspond to reality itself. &lt;a href="../../attachment/images/psychometaphysics/scientist.jpg"&gt;A guy in a white lab coat peering into a microscope&lt;/a&gt; stands for “science,” even if it’s just a priest who dressed up that way. A chain of reasoning that proceeds from premises through inferences to conclusions looks like logic, even if &lt;a href="../../attachment/images/psychometaphysics/analytic.png"&gt;the argument actually obeys no formal logic whatsoever&lt;/a&gt;. Spock, calmly and emotionlessly stating the mission success probability to five decimal places stands for cold rationality, even if the number was pulled out of thin air. On the flip side, loud emotional outbursts or an old man in robes clutching a crucifix and speaking in Church Slavonic – &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; are the conventional symbols for the enemy of rational thought.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The word “prayer” still firmly belongs to the enemy genre of religion; the word “meditation,” thanks to the efforts of secular Buddhists, has been successfully yanked from the religion genre into the genre of perfectly cromulent psychotherapy. In reality the two practices are quite similar, both religiously and scientifically. But blurring the line between map and territory makes us think about them in radically different ways. Sometimes it feels like the symbols on the map actually exist in the real world, like you could trip over a meridian…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When the Buddha explained why karma isn’t tied to a specific physical body, he called it “santana” — a stream of separate dharmas connected to each other by the principle of pratītya-samutpāda. That’s religion and mysticism. If a rationalist talks about “bad karma,” it’s only ever metaphorically; hearing those words makes Richard Dawkins’s eyeballs roll upward on pure spinal reflex. Thousands of years later, Eliezer Yudkowsky, founder of the rationalist movement, promoted the idea of &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/cryonics"&gt;cryonics&lt;/a&gt; — freezing your body after death in the hope that one day you can be thawed and revived. Many people worried that the person revived wouldn’t be the same person, just a copy with your memories and personality. Trying to explain why there’s no reason to fear that, Eliezer — starting from fundamental physics — described why &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RLScTpwc5W2gGGrL9/identity-isn-t-in-specific-atoms"&gt;personal identity is not tied to specific atoms&lt;/a&gt;, but emerges as a sequence of states connected causally. If you strip away the scary Sanskrit words, these are &lt;i&gt;very similar&lt;/i&gt; ideas. Yudkowsky’s explanation differs in details, but he and the Buddha could easily have found common ground. They disagree in the same way followers of different interpretations of quantum mechanics disagree, or the way economists from the Frankfurt, Keynesian, and Austrian schools disagree — not like an atheist and a believer, but like two theorists working in the same field. They even used similar metaphors: Yudkowsky’s “&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/924arDrTu3QRHFA5r/timeless-identity"&gt;river that never flows&lt;/a&gt;” and Buddha‘s “mindstream.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I’m not trying to claim Yudkowsky plagiarized the Buddha here. I’m pointing out that if Yudkowsky’s blog posts feel a priori less mystical to you than the Buddha’s sutras, your map is leaking into the territory. They are speaking in different &lt;i&gt;literary genres&lt;/i&gt;, using different symbols on their respective maps, but they are often trying to describe the same territory. Scary Sanskrit words like “skandha” are used on religious maps, while scary Latin words like “determinism” are used on scientific maps, but you shouldn’t immediately assume they’re talking about different territories.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Tweedledee, why does anything exist in the first place?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Fuck if I know. Thousands of options.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Name three.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Actually I’m a fan of the weak anthropic principle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: …which is a metaphysical claim.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Bullshit. Five hundred years ago it was metaphysics; now we know enough astrophysics to say yeah, the universe simply permits the existence of observers. Those are its laws. Why? I don’t give a shit. Well, not that I literally don’t give a shit, but definitely not enough to go poking around the initial singularity without real data and start making claims that are physically unverifiable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Please give me the experimental protocol that would confirm the weak anthropic principle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: You can just take it as a given because you have zero causal influence on your own existence in the past.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: So can we just take Allah as a given too?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: The weak anthropic principle can be taken as a given, right? On the basis of non-experimental reasoning, right? Purely on the basis of metaphysics, right? So why that and not Allah?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: For much the same reason I can take my own existence as a given.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: And can you experimentally confirm that little inference of yours?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here and below I’m basically digging with a knife right at the seam where map meets territory. On one hand, physicalism/scientism/verificationism (with all differences between those swept under the rug) is declared the one and only correct grid, while “metaphysics” gets tossed into the same bin as religion and magic. On the other hand, plenty of their strong opinions about the nature of reality simply do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fit inside that grid, so they have to be impaled on one of the horns of the dilemma — either reject them on the same grounds they reject God, or try to somehow cram them into the grid anyway. Or, alternatively, have a sudden Zen-student-hit-by-stick moment and realize that metaphysics and religion are not the same kind of stuff, no matter how much they bleed into each other on the map.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Atheism is better than Buddhism because it doesn‘t include anything. It’s literally just the “nuh-uh” opinion about the supernatural nature of the world. That’s it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Atheism is better than Buddhism because it doesn’t include metaphysics. Or, depending on whether nongolfing is a hobby, at the very least it comes with an asterisk that says “any metaphysics can be tossed out the window for being utterly useless.” Appealing to supernatural in arguments in 2024 is cringe. It used to be cringe in the past, too. But now it’s more obvious than ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Honestly, this is an insanely stupid bias. When people are choosing between two otherwise equivalent descriptions of a room, one of which has an invisible pink unicorn and one doesn’t, they pick [table, chair, …, bed] instead of [table, chair, …, bed, invisible pink unicorn]. But for some reason when it comes to philosophy, the choice between [verifiable property 1, verifiable property 2, …, verifiable property n] and [verifiable property 1, verifiable property 2, …, verifiable property n, metaphysics made of unverifiable properties] suddenly isn’t obvious at all. And on top of that they try to convince you that you’re not using [table, chair, …, bed], but [table, chair, …, bed, no invisible pink unicorn].&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Because people like metaphysics that strokes their fragile feelings. Because human thinking works like [object 1, …, object n, (why I’m a good person)]. And when they see a system that’s just [object 1, …, object n], they fill the gap with whatever they see. They see emptiness and they fill it. But emptiness has to be framed somehow. So they frame it with some bullshit. For them it’s already an existential threat if someone else fills (why I’m a good person) with something different from their version. That would prove all their beliefs are fucked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: In theory I don‘t mind pure metaphysics; it’s just that any metaphysics postulates the existence of certain elements that supposedly affect things but themselves can’t be affected. Which on a fundamental level is garbage. It only makes sense in math for building extremely simplified models.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: “Because it doesn‘t include anything” is a weird criterion. By that logic “not knowing physics” is better than “knowing physics,” since not-knowing-physics also includes nothing and has no opinion about the mathematical structure of the world. You’re concluding that having no opinion about X is better than having one. Meaning that in a hypothetical situation where X actually exists and is relevant, you’re a priori ruling out the possibility of ever knowing it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Well, like, if religions were treated strictly as a study of humanistic values, I’d have way fewer problems with it. But religiosity inevitably includes claims about the nature of the physical world. And when those claims turn out false, it doesn’t force believers to abandon/revise the religion; it forces them to abandon/revise the tools for understanding the world. Religion refuses to just be a study of behavior. Religion always drags metaphysical mechanisms along with it. Which, yeah, are completely fucking useless. Better to have no opinion about metaphysics than to have one. Because metaphysics doesn’t exist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: The argument “but what if we should have an opinion just in case it exists” goes in the same garbage bin as “but shouldn’t we believe in God just in case he exists”: neither one explains why this particular metaphysics/God deserves belief over any other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I don’t use metaphysical objects in my models. That’s it, that’s my claim. You can call it “metaphysical” if you want, I don’t give a shit. God isn’t needed in the model of the solar system. His absence from the equations of motion isn’t a metaphysical claim.&lt;br&gt;
y = kx + b contains no metaphysics.&lt;br&gt;
y = kx + b + 0*GOD contains metaphysics, but no metaphysical objects.&lt;br&gt;
y = kx + b + GOD is just garbage.&lt;br&gt;
At the same time, versions 1 and 2 are essentially equivalent, so I use them interchangeably because their non-equivalence is a matter of cheap, useless rhetoric.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: You don’t use the objects, but you regularly make metaphysical claims anyway.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All this technobabble is basically the proverbial five blind men from the parable groping Occam's razor and saying it smells like blood. Occam‘s razor is actually an excellent point to bring up here. But there's a definite rift between the "everyday" understanding of Occam's razor and &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/f4txACqDWithRi7hs/occam-s-razor"&gt;the way it actually works on a fundamental level&lt;/a&gt;. Eliezer Yudkowsky &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/viPPjojmChxLGPE2v/the-dilemma-science-or-bayes"&gt;criticized science and experimental verifiability&lt;/a&gt;, and it's precisely the understanding of this rift that, in his view, distinguishes science from rationality. That's the angle I'm trying to work from here, to add some nuance and nudge toward that moment of realization.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Something that isn't experimentally verifiable by the scientific method could theoretically turn out to be relevant.&lt;br&gt;
For example: suppose there's some god who does only one thing: watches whether you've ever eaten pork in your life, and if you have, he teleports your consciousness to eternal hell after death. Otherwise, to eternal paradise.&lt;br&gt;
It would be useful to know about this! Because if that's the case, you'd better not eat pork.&lt;br&gt;
Of course, the a priori probability of this is extremely low. But if it did happen to be true — it would be useful to know about it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Princess! In that case, being an atheist is equivalent to believing in the opposite god! If you believe in the pork god, but the real one is the beef god, then you're wasting calories for nothing!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Tweedledum, I think you missed what the Princess was saying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I'm not trying to shoehorn Pascal's Wager in here. I'm just saying — knowing about this non-experimentally verifiable thing would be useful! And if there were some way to find out, you should do it! If you could figure it out through reasoning about metaphysics — you should reason about metaphysics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: That's a well-known claim in favor of religion. It's literally Pascal's Wager. If there's an unverifiable god, you should believe in MY unverifiable god.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: That's not the argument. It's not about acting on some low probability.&lt;br&gt;
It's about the fact that knowing whether it's true or not would be practically useful.&lt;br&gt;
This is a metaphysical claim that's not experimentally verifiable, and yet it would give you positive utility from knowing for sure whether it is or isn't, and which of the two opposite gods exists, if any.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: How would you obtain information about a metaphysical object? With what?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Do you agree with the statement that it would be useful to know?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: No. That would be unverifiable knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Evasive maneuvers. Also, you’re once again refusing to engage with the Princess’s proposal on her own terms. Damn, Princess, you were absolutely right about people not understanding hypotheticals. Tweedledum, you’re rigging the thought experiment you‘ve been given.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Well, like… fine. Okay. The knowledge in a vacuum would be useful. But you can’t obtain it through belief in metaphysics. Therefore that vacuum-knowledge would itself be some form of faith. Which is not useful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: In general, the usefulness of that knowledge is about the same as the usefulness of knowledge about electrons for a caveman. If you magically beamed it into his head, he wouldn’t exactly do a whole lot with it. Apart from the basic “be less afraid of lightning.” In any case, talking about the usefulness of knowledge about the pork god is pointless; knowledge doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t pop out of nowhere. That’s metaphysics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Let’s do the reverse example.&lt;br&gt;
People want to colonize the nearest galactic cluster and send a generation ship there. You want to go with them — Earth is overpopulated, you think you’d be better off there.&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, by the time the ship arrives, it will have crossed the cosmological horizon, and Earth will never be able to get information back from it. A person on Earth literally has no way of ever finding out what happens there. If a Cthulhu spawns from the warp space and devours the ship, a person on Earth will never know. Whatever happens there is experimentally unverifiable.&lt;br&gt;
It would be useful for you to know whether such a Cthulhu is going to appear! It would be useful to know what fate awaits you when you fly there! But you can’t find out directly via experiment, because the information physically cannot reach you due to the speed-of-light limit.&lt;br&gt;
Yet you can reason using metaphysical considerations like the Copernican principle and the fact that it’s unlikely the neighboring galaxy has different laws of physics. So if there are no Cthulhus here, you can assume there won’t be any there either! (Though if you’re wrong and there are, you’ll never find out.)&lt;br&gt;
Purely logical-philosophical reasoning about experimentally unverifiable aspects of reality gives you information that is relevant to you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Here are two mirror-image cases.&lt;br&gt;
In both cases there is information you cannot experimentally verify, but that matters to you.&lt;br&gt;
In the pork-god case you assume one thing, in the neighboring galactic cluster case you assume another.&lt;br&gt;
Neither is experimentally verifiable.&lt;br&gt;
Yet purely on the basis of metaphysical reasoning you conclude that the probability of the pork god is extremely low, while the probability that the same laws of physics apply in that cluster is extremely high.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: That’s not metaphysics. Because all those grounds about physical principles and the absence of Cthulhu are physical facts, not metaphysical ones.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The smartest readers have already figured out that the pork-god example and the galactic-cluster example are, as far as experimental verification goes, exactly the same example. In both cases there’s an experimentally unprovable and unfalsifiable danger; knowledge of which would be useful for making decisions right now. One is phrased in the genre of religion (the same language as Pascal’s Wager), the other in the genre of rationality (&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3XMwPNMSbaPm2suGz/belief-in-the-implied-invisible"&gt;taken literally from Yudkowsky&lt;/a&gt;). “These are physical facts, not metaphysical ones” — is the perfect hit on exactly what I’ve been steering toward. The difference between physics and metaphysics is purely one of genre, not substance. The exact same question is solved with different mental tools depending on how it’s labeled on the map.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You cannot experimentally verify that the laws of physics are the same in that cluster as in this one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: We conclude that the laws of physics are the same because no observations contradict them. Actually, scratch that: we CREATED the laws of physics on the assumption that they’re the same everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: And how do we know they’re the same everywhere?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: It’s the assumption required to even start doing anything at all. We simply assume the laws are the same everywhere because that’s simpler than assuming they’re different.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Our astronomical data about very distant clusters is nowhere near precise enough to be absolutely sure some slightly different stuff isn’t going on there. We don’t even know the nature of dark matter. So in a hypothetical where the laws of physics really are different in the neighboring cluster, you’re a priori ruling that possibility out of consideration, right?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: We simply don’t have the math apparatus for different laws of physics, and we don’t build one until we need it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Once again — there could perfectly well be a physical phenomenon that is unknowable not because it’s supernatural, but because information about it physically cannot reach you across the speed-of-light barrier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: We don’t make 16-mm bolts if we don’t have 16-mm wrenches. When they are needed, we’ll have both bolts and wrenches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: “We can’t know anything for sure, therefore we should beat women in the face for going outside without a hijab.” Solid plan. If metaphysics is so unknowable, how do you make any claims about it at all?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: It’s knowable — just not through experiments!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Then it’s a physical phenomenon. Princess is defending metaphysics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Fine, physics not metaphysics, doesn‘t really matter, your criterion of experimental verifiability sucks either way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: The laws of physics in the neighboring cluster are experimentally verifiable. Just not by us and not from here. But they are verifiable in principle. There could be an experiment that checks them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Well, if heaver exists, its laws are experimentally verifiable to the inhabitants of heaven. And to conclude that one place that is  unverifiable to you but not to them exists while another doesn’t — you need metaphysics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Seriously, all I’m seeing is “our based assumptions that are necessary for us to work” vs “your rotten metaphysics that doesn‘t metter” and it seems to stem purely from some prior bias imo. It even stops you from engaging with the Princess’s proposals on her own terms.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Metaphysics: this is truth. Everything that disagrees with it is false.&lt;br&gt;
Scientific hypothesis: let’s suppose this is truth. Everything that disagrees with it is a reason to change the hypothesis.&lt;br&gt;
That’s the fucking difference.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Good point, but notice that you’re making a claim about the nature of reality not because you ran an experiment and discovered there’s no heaven, but because “historically everyone who talked like that was wrong, so they’ll probably keep being wrong.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: We generalize: “those guys obviously weren’t there and are just bullshitting. If they ever happen to guess right, it’s pure luck.” From metaphysical models you can’t extract anything physically useful in any non-random way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But there have been cases where exactly this kind of reasoning chain turned out to be correct.&lt;br&gt;
People reasoned about hypothetical parallel universes for a very long time on all sorts of grounds and were systematically wrong — until Hugh Everett came up with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and then eternal inflation came along, and suddenly the latest multiverse hypothesis isn’t looking so crazy anymore!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Following this lead, the Tweedle gang dives straight into the problem of induction. David Hume already laid out pretty clearly why induction can only be assumed a priori and can’t actually be derived from anything else. Even though I‘ve only heard his arguments through five layers of game of telephone, that’s enough to know how to render the idea in the genre of rationality.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Princess, do you think your next step northward will dissolve you into fucking nothingness in defiance of all known physics?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: No, I don’t. Why?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: On the basis of what data? Did you pull it from the future? That’s exactly why I don’t think the laws of physics will be different in that cluster. Because on the next step they won’t be. And then induction takes over.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Yes, but you still haven’t experimentally checked what will happen in the neighboring cluster or on your very next step. You concluded it on the basis of some extra considerations like “the laws of physics have always been stable, so why the fuck would they destabilize now.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: It’s a statistical claim. I admit it might not be perfectly accurate. But it’s good enough as a basis. We’ll adjust it later. As needed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Well, that’s induction: “if it’s always been this way, it’ll probably stay this way.” How do you justify that claim? Why not the opposite?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Uh, it just so happens that time flows forward. If it flowed backward I’d say the opposite.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Well, maybe in one second it will stop flowing forward. It’s always flowed forward until now, and now it’ll stop. On what basis do you conclude that’s unlikely?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: On the basis that it’s never happened? If it stops — we’ll think then.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Yet you’re still acting from the assumption “if it stops we’ll think then, but for now we assume it won’t,” and not from the reverse “we expect it to stop, and if it turns out it doesn’t we’ll think then.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Because the current laws of physics don’t imply it. I see no point in thinking about things they don’t imply until I actually run into the phenomenon. Otherwise you can invent endless bullshit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Okay, but that’s justifying induction using induction. Negation of induction can be justified the exact same way using negation of induction. Look:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tweedledee says: “The principle of induction is true — if it’s worked so far, it’ll keep working; if the laws of physics have always been this way, they won’t suddenly change next moment. I conclude the principle is true because it has always been true up to now — it’s never failed me yet (so it won’t fail me this time either).”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anti-Tweedledee says: “The principle of anti-induction is true — if it’s worked so far, next time it will definitely be the opposite; if the laws of physics have always been this way, next moment they’ll be different. I conclude the principle is true because it has never been true before, it has always failed me (so this time it definitely won’t fail).”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Can you give a specific reason why you’re Tweedledee and not Anti-Tweedledee?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Because I accept the premise of knowability of the world. That’s the only claim of mine I’m willing to admit is borderline metaphysical. And even that one is testable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Anti-Tweedledee also starts from the knowability of the world and concludes that next moment the world will be unknowable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I assume its knowability at every point in time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Why?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Because otherwise you can’t do anything productive, because you can’t plan anything.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But maybe on the very next step the opposite becomes true — maybe only in an unknowable world can you be productive?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: But right now that’s not the case. When it becomes the case — give me a call.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Anti-Tweedledee: THEREFORE NEXT TIME IT DEFINITELY WILL BE THAT WAY.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Remember I linked you that crazy witch‘s channel? You can read her posts; she fits the Anti-Tweedledee description perfectly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: No, she’s an inductionist too. She made claims like “it worked for our ancestors, so it’ll work for us, ancient wisdom and all.” She never made the reverse claim “it worked for our ancestors, therefore it definitely won’t work for us.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Induction works, anti-induction doesn’t work. Anti-Tweedledee doesn’t work either. By induction.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Tweedledee: “Therefore induction will keep working!”&lt;br&gt;
Anti-Tweedledee: “Therefore induction will stop working!”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: The fact that Anti-Tweedledee works in an anti-universe is metaphysics and I don‘t give a fuck. All right, are you done talking bullshit?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: So far your line is basically “experimentally unverifiable considerations one level above physics are just default assumptions because I logically derived them (if &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; derived them), whereas your shitty metaphysics can fuck off (if someone else derived it).” Both are metaphysics. You just picked the most everyday, comfort-zone metaphysics that’s “good enough for my job, why fix what‘s not broken,” axiomatically declared “this rifle is mine” and decided everything else can fuck off. Which is of course a respectable choice, but someone else using the exact same cognitive meta-algorithm will say “the Quran works great for my life and feels comfy, why dig deeper, Allah wouldn’t tell a lie”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Allah doesn’t work. If he did work, I’d be writing that assuming his existence is correct. But he doesn’t work. By the very definition of “works.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Have you ever in your life actually read the arguments of &amp;gt;120 IQ theists (there are plenty now and even more in the past, Newton for example) in favor of their faith?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Bottom line: my attitude toward knowledge and information is ultra-radical right-utilitarian. Because any other options don’t produce working models except by pure accident.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Okay, maybe I missed something. Let’s say we need to know whether it’s the pork god or the beef god. That’s metaphysics, meaning we can’t know it. What’s the point of striving for something fundamentally unknowable? Same question about the neighboring cluster. If we can’t find out, yet we need to know, what do we actually do? What’s the practical use of metaphysics as a “science” that just says “it’s incomprehensible”?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: It doesn’t say it’s incomprehensible; it actually gives tools for answering experimentally unverifiable but still decision-relevant questions like “how confidently can we assume the laws of physics are the same in the neighboring cluster so our colony won’t die in agony?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Fine. What does that have to do with the Buddhist hell for menstruating women?&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.bloodbowl" class="footref" href="#fn.bloodbowl" role="doc-backlink"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Nothing. That was an example of a wrong metaphysical claim. Just like there used to be wrong physical claims like “combustion happens because of phlogiston” or “light travels instantaneously.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Is there a methodology for checking the validity of a metaphysical claim, and if yes, why call it metaphysical at all?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: We haven’t synthesized one yet, but we’re already making (and you do, too) some preliminary metaphysical inferences like “there’s no reason to think the universe will dissolve into chaos in the next moment, even though we have no way to test it.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: But can such a methodology even be synthesized at all? And if it can, why wouldn’t it just be physics?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I don’t know. But it had already happened before that philosophical claims migrated into the domain of physics, so it’s not out of the question.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Tweedledee, do you think that “what was true in the past must be true now” is true in general? Larry Wachowski was a boy back then, so he still is now? Or do you actually sort claims into those for which induction applies, those for which it doesn’t, and to what it applies partially? On what basis?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I have up-to-date data that Wachowski is not a boy now. And is there even one single metaphysical claim that isn’t wrong? “What has always been true in the past is correct to assume will always be true in the future, provided nothing intervenes.” That’s my more accurate take on induction.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: If metaphysics is the science of how to give the right answer when you can’t run an experiment, then it should have at least one use-case that stays correct in the absence of any possibility to run an experiment on it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Throughout the entire history of the universe the statement “if Tweedledee is alive, Joe Biden is also alive” has been true. Will it be true forever? There are tons of people who are boys right now but might stop being boys. You don’t have data on them. Yet you still don’t claim that everyone who is a boy now will remain one forever.&lt;br&gt;
You assume that when you send a colony to the neighboring galactic cluster beyond the event horizon, the laws of physics there will be similar enough that you can count on it. Although once it flies beyond the event horizon you won’t be able to run any experiments.&lt;br&gt;
By the way, did you know that mathematics was once considered a branch of metaphysics? Pythagoras himself said he was doing metaphysics. It was such a successful piece of metaphysics that we spun it off into its own discipline.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here I messed up and got it wrong — it wasn’t Pythagoras himself who said he was doing metaphysics, but Aristotle who said it about Pythagoras. Still, it’s a pretty interesting example in this context. Pythagoras wasn’t really doing mathematics so much as numerology; he built an entire cult around numbers. For him mathematics was a mystical pursuit — the study of unobservable ideal forms. Plato’s idea of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms"&gt;Platonic forms&lt;/a&gt; — objectively existing perfect, non-physical, eternal objects — was a direct development of Pythagoras’s ideas. Platonism is now considered an outdated view, yet this completely unscientific mysticism gave birth to all of mathematics more abstract than ancient architecture. The mathematics is undeniably useful in real life, even though it sits on a meta-level relative to physics. If back in ancient Greece there had been a hypothetical Tweedledum telling Pythagoras and Plato what a bunch of delusional cultists they were, he would have ended up on the wrong side of history. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions"&gt;That’s roughly how knowledge has worked throughout history&lt;/a&gt;, because that’s how our psychology is wired.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Nah. Mathematics is verifiable and repeatable on some physical quantities. And about the colony — yeah, &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; personally won’t be able to check. But the colony will be able to. It’s not unverifiable in principle. It’s just unverifiable &lt;b&gt;for me&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: The same is true for the people who end up in pork hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Only &lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; they end up in hell. Verifiability beyond the horizon is based on the fact that something exists there. The fact that something exists there we can somehow verify. Like, we know about that cluster from somewhere. We could see it earlier, before it flew away. The very fact that the colony is flying there and will arrive already assumes all the reasoning. You start from “the colony is flying somewhere and will get there.” Pork hell is unverifiable by itself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Give me an experimental test that there are infinitely many prime numbers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: In a hypothetical situation? Well, you can always add one more. I get that mathematical abstractions have, well, levels of abstraction. But they are based in reality. In mathematics there are no quantities that are fundamentally unknowable in any way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You derived that with armchair reasoning. Now show me a physical experiment whose outcome would differ depending on whether there are infinitely many primes or not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: You take any repeatable process, repeat it, and count how many times it happened. If the primes run out but the process can still be repeated, then there are finitely many primes. I know counting to infinity is tedious, but strictly speaking, counting any finite number is possible. If we have infinite time, any finite number can be counted. So at minimum we can determine one of the outcomes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You’re basically proposing to enumerate the primes. But if they’re infinite, you’ll never find out. When you’ve done it a googol times, you still won’t know whether there are infinitely many or two googols.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: But if you do it a googol times and the primes run out right there, you’ll know they’re finite.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: And how do you verify that they actually ran out versus there are more but you just haven’t counted far enough?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Well, if you can’t produce a new one, then it‘s impossible to count further.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You don‘t think there is a calculation that is possible in principle but that I can‘t do! That’s a huge compliment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Well, yeah. Strictly speaking, there’s no reason why &lt;b&gt;any&lt;/b&gt; form of life couldn’t in principle perform any mathematical calculation at the lowest possible physical-operation level. Sure, most of them are colossal projects that humans can’t realistically pull off. But they’re fundamentally possible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Isn’t it fucking awesome that we have metaphysical reasoning that lets us figure this out without those colossal projects?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Awesome — as long as it has 100% overlap with verifiable facts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You’ll get to hell and verify it there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: If there is a hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: And how would you know whether there is or isn’t if you didn’t do metaphysics?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: And if I did? You obviously do metaphysics. So… is there?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Doesn’t look like it. But you do metaphysics, too. Out of the two unverifiable assumptions “hell exists” and “hell doesn’t exist,” you picked “hell doesn’t exist” — I agree with you, but the reasoning you used to pick it is the domain of metaphysics. Metaphysics can be done at different levels of veracity. Stephen Hawking did physics, and some guy in Podunk assembling an IKEA table and realizing that if he keeps pushing the wood will break was also doing physics. The former expands our understanding; the latter just uses known facts at a household level. Same with metaphysics. You chose to eat pork even though the probability of going to hell for it is non-zero. The considerations that led you to that choice aren’t “I experimentally checked and there’s no hell.” It‘s basic garden variety metaphysics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: No. I might even choose not to eat pork. It’s just not a thing I care about. In general I don’t bother asking whether some supernatural forces exist that will fuck me over for eating pork, drinking alcohol, killing flies, menstruating, or whatever else.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You don’t worry about forces that might punish you for pork, but you do worry about forces that will put you in prison if you beat up your neighbor. On what grounds do you care about one but not the other?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: When I read the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, I did it keeping in mind the actual enforcement mechanisms and all that stuff.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But not because you ran the experiment of beating up your neighbor and doing time for it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: I know the Criminal Code at least sometimes gets enforced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: On what grounds?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: I dunno… they write about it in the papers. My trust in information is based on my understanding of how that information is obtained. I know the church’s goal is to indoctrinate the population, so I believe their fairy tales very weakly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: In medieval Europe they wrote a ton about divine punishments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: And we both know that was bullshit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But that’s not because you experimentally verified it. You never experimentally tested what the church’s goal was back then.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: And all of it is crap that doesn’t work.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: So basically you reached conclusions based on things like the strength of arguments, not experiments?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: And in the end I’ve never in my life seen anything supernatural, nor heard of anyone who reliably did. Those considerations are based on verifiability.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: [REDACTED] told us stories about seeing aliens. Tons of people have reported supernatural stuff. But you concluded they shouldn’t be believed — why exactly?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: That anti-empiricism argument “how can empiricism work if you have to check absolutely everything” isn’t in good faith, btw. Because they reported some bullshit that contradicts everything else. People who’ve had clinical death report all kinds of random crap. That doesn’t mean there’s actually anything there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: So how did you conclude it’s bullshit that contradicts everything else? Why don’t you seriously consider the hypothesis that you urgently need to stop eating pork or you’ll go to hell? The hypothesis that there’s no hell and pork is fine is equally unverifiable. Out of two experimentally indistinguishable hypotheses you picked one — you eat pork. Why that one specifically?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: These are not equivalent things. Seriously. Why do you think “absence” is just some edge case of “presence”?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Exactly how are they non-equivalent? Justify it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: No, you first.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I’m justifying it on the basis of metaphysical considerations. But you don’t accept those.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Why does “there is no supernatural” have equal standing with “literally every supernatural thing anyone can imagine exists”?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: On what grounds do you draw the line between supernatural and not-supernatural? Quantum mechanics looked like total schizo back in the day. It took a huge amount of work to fit it into a materialist worldview, but that wasn’t a reason to reject it from the start, was it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Okay, I hereby postulate that there exist kwooks that are attached to every living human and lurce. What do you say to that?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I don’t know what that means.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: All right. But do they exist or not?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I don’t know, because I don’t know what those words mean. That’s not the same as “I don’t know whether kwooks exist or not.”&lt;br&gt;
If I make a statement to you in Chinese right now, you also won’t be able to say whether it’s true or false. It could be obviously true, obviously false, or “I don’t know.” And if I say in Chinese “two plus two equals four” and you reply “I don’t know if that’s true,” it doesn’t mean you don’t know what two plus two is — it means you don’t speak Chinese.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Cool. But you’re expecting me to give an answer about your pork god. That’s something I literally cannot gather any information about. Why should I give any answer at all to this obviously contrived question?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You do understand every word about the pork god, though. You can conceptualize a universe where it’s true and a universe where it’s false. Yet you know which universe you’re in and eat pork without worry. Why?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Because kwooks might lurce? What’s the difference between supernatural kwooks that lurce and a supernatural god that punishes?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: A god is a concrete hypothesis that can be true or false (in this case, probably false). “Kwooks” and “lurcing” are words that mean nothing.&lt;br&gt;
“There is a god or there isn’t” is a valid function that returns “false”.&lt;br&gt;
“Kwooks exist” throws an error “variable kwooks undefined”.&lt;br&gt;
If you explain to me what those words mean — on the same level that a dictionary can define “god” and “hell” — then I can try to tell whether they exist or not. Right now I don’t even know if they’re supposed to be supernatural. Maybe in ancient Sumerian “kwook” means ass and “lurcing” means eating oats, in which case they just exist, asses eating oats, no magic required.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This moment in the dialogue was painful. I had led Tweedledum right up to the map–territory distinction, but he grasped defeat from the jaws of victory. I cannot definitively say whether God exists because I have no way to look and check. I cannot answer whether kwooks exist because I don’t know what the word means. The first question is about the territory; the second is about the map.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But if the moment back then was unpleasant, now I’m actually glad it happened — it is an incredibly direct, live demonstration of exactly the problem I’m describing: the “techbro” mode of thinking doesn’t give strong intuitive tools for telling map apart from territory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Like, why should I even care about the infinitely large multitude of human fantasies that make unfalsifiable or falsified claims about the supernatural? I can invent as many kwooks that lurce as I want and shove them down people’s throats. Some will even believe it if I market it well enough. But it’s all the same bullshit as religious books or New Age spiritualism. They offer two options — both unverifiable — and then emotionally pressure you into picking the one they want. Take hell out of your metaphysics. Just a god who binary-counts whether a person ate pork or not. The correct response is “so fucking what?” But add eternal life after death and horrific torment and suddenly it’s “why not pick the safe option?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Yes, but why do you accept some claims of that format and reject others? Why do you reject the priest’s claim about God but accept the physicist’s claim about the Big Bang, even though you’ve personally seen neither?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Because I know the processes by which the Big Bang claim was arrived at.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: And why did you pick the option you picked? On what grounds? I’m not saying your choice is wrong; I’m trying to get you to reflect on your own thinking process here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Even if I personally can’t redo all the math, I trust peer review and public scrutiny enough to take scientific claims on faith.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Okay, but on what basis do you consider some processes more trustworthy than others? Why do you trust peer review published by research institutes more than angelic revelations published by messiahs?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: I’m telling you: I know the principles they follow. I know I can sit down and redo the calculations myself. At the very least, I know I could sell a kidney and hire people to spoon-feed me every single step. It’s all fundamentally possible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You can also go to an imam and have him spoon-feed you the Quran.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: The Quran will still remain a book written by some guy in the 7th century after a supernatural revelation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Both “hell exists” and “hell does not exist” are unverifiable. What exactly creates the asymmetry between them?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: No matter which way you slice it, it will still be based on something strictly unverifiable. You’re not getting my point.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: The first one multiplies entities unnecessarily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Okay, that’s actually better! Occam’s razor!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Fuck Occam’s razor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
…all right, scratch that, didn‘t work.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You make choices based on unverifiable considerations. You do things that would land you in hell if the Quran were true.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Princess, can you name even one piece of metaphysical knowledge with non-zero usefulness? Simple question.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: “No one will send you to hell for jerking off, go ahead and wank in peace.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Tweedledee, first you make metaphysical claims and say that “they’re necessary to get anything done at all,” and then you ask the Princess to give you a metaphysical “piece of knowledge” with non-zero usefulness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I guarantee you: if right now it somehow turned out you were wrong, hell is actually experimentally verifiable, and if you don’t stop masturbating you’ll go to hell — you’d stop masturbating.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Yeah, but then it wouldn’t be metaphysics anymore.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But you’re choosing between two claims about the laws of physics in reality. Why is one a factor for you and the other isn’t?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Metaphysics isn’t when dumb fundies believe in a sky daddy sitting on a cloud.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: For me, existence = interactivity. In principle even a schizophrenic’s hallucinations exist materially (in his brain). Metaphysics simply does not exist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: So for you material existence equals “interactivity”?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Yes. Existence = interactivity. Base-level. There are edge cases like deep quantum mechanics, but there it’s just “shut up and calculate”.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: I already wrote this: I know that a chain of experiments from the physical world all the way to the &lt;b&gt;theory&lt;/b&gt; of the Big Bang can in principle be carried out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: The same can be done for “God created the world in seven days.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: No. There will inevitably be an element of taking someone’s word for it — that is, faith.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: So for you something that “exists” for one person and something that “exists” for several people “exists” equally? Materialism = idealism?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Uh… shit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Gotcha. Materialism is solipsism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: If we’re in the same class of existence, then for me everything that exists for all elements of the class exists.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: What if interactivity is one-way?&lt;br&gt;
What happens in our universe affects another, but what happens in the other does not affect ours.&lt;br&gt;
How does existence work then?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Find me such an object, then we’ll proceed with the discussion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea that “existence” is relational — that things exist only relative to each other to the exact degree that they interact — is a thought I’ve had before and expressed myself. It‘s probably some kind of “-ism”; I just hadn’t seen it outside my own head until this conversation. But it &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; metaphysics. Tweedledee is doing pure metaphysics, trying to answer the exact same questions Aristotle tackled in his book literally titled &lt;b&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/b&gt;. With the right questions you can push him to Aristotle’s literal takes. After several pages of discussion about the foundations of mathematics…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You can consider a different set of axioms. But you cannot change the consequences that follow from a given set of axioms. We could burn every neuron and leave only silicon robots that operate under the laws of mathematics as we know them. But we cannot leave robots that violate those laws and, say, solve the Turing halting problem. The laws of mathematics are read-only for us. We can study them, but we cannot change them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: In your view does all of mathematics exist at once? Meaning the whole thing is already there, and we don’t create anything in it — we only discover?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Debatable, but I am nevertheless certain of the fact that we cannot build a robot that can solver the halting problem. And the constraints that prevent us from doing so are read-only for us; we cannot alter them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: At the same time those constraints are very much physical and have a representation in the form of neural activity. The fact that we can only build robots using that activity is secondary.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: If we stopped all neural activity in the world and left only silicon brains, those constraints would remain. When evolution built us these brains, it was operating within the constraints of fundamental mathematics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Well… no?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Do you think some other form of life not running on neurons could build such a robot?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Hm, actually that means the constraint isn’t read-only after all. Yeah, this is messy. A constraint of the universe is a &lt;b&gt;rule&lt;/b&gt;, not a &lt;b&gt;property&lt;/b&gt;. To turn it into a property you have to turn it into a thought, and that’s already interactive. For a pawn, the rules of how it moves don’t exist as an object; they’re simply the phase space of its possibilities. Once you frame it as a thought, it becomes an object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
…Tweedledee is now literally reconstructing Aristotle’s arguments from "Metaphysics". The distinctions between an object and its property is literal Aristotle. The distinctions between the laws of physics and their approximations, or applying concepts like “phase space” to the physical universe — these are the foundations of metaphysics. They are the background assumptions we inevitably rely on when we work with physical laws. Or, going back to the original framing, these are the grids we use to look at physics.&lt;br&gt;
You cannot do physics without doing metaphysics in some indirect sense — the same way you cannot cook without doing chemistry in some sense, or write text without doing linguistics in some sense. Even if you don’t know the full laws governing what you’re doing, that doesn’t mean the laws don’t exist or aren’t necessary. And on the level of raw pragmatism, the ability to reason at the “meta” level about physics is indispensable &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mpaqTWGiLT7GA3w76/einstein-s-speed"&gt;if the goal is to actually advance physics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org11319c4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org11319c4"&gt;Shaman King&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org11319c4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fact that I successfully un-compressed the concept of “metaphysics” and separated it from “unverifiable unscientific magic for fundies” is a good start, but unverifiable unscientific magic for fundies is still bad, right?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: FFS, basic assumptions are things I can touch. The factor of faith here is just that I’m too lazy to do it right now, but yes, I do believe I &lt;b&gt;could&lt;/b&gt;. Faith that I can count rocks up to ten somehow isn’t as outrageous as faith in unknowable bullshit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Tons of people have reported personal mystical experiences.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Which are mystical only according to their own say-so, sure. Eat some mushrooms from a materialist paradigm and the mysticism vanishes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Look. A huge number of people made the specific inference that a watch cannot exist without a watchmaker, and that the existence of complex life — which you can directly see and touch — is exactly the same kind of direct evidence for God as bear shit in a forest is evidence for a bear. To refute that particular argument you had to discover the completely non-obvious idea of evolution. Historically, “I only believe what I can observe and directly extrapolate in a long chain” had not been an infallible move.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Those were errors within the materialist worldview, yeah. But it’s not 100% errors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But blindly trusting it 100% and following it off a cliff isn’t smart either.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: No. BUT. You definitely can’t trust magic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You also shouldn’t trust your intuitive judgment about what counts as “magic” versus “just insufficiently analyzed technology.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: You &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; trust your judgment that magic doesn’t exist in principle. It’s a statistically correct claim.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: That doesn’t mean that every time you encounter something that looks inexplicable and supernatural to you, you’re justified in going “that’s magic → therefore it doesn’t exist.” Because it might not be magic at all — it might just be physics/technology you don’t understand yet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: That means any weird shit you see is science.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Fair enough — if I’m actually seeing it, the very fact that I’m seeing it has to be physically explainable somehow. Even if the correct explanation turns out to be “it wasn’t a UFO, just light bouncing off a cloud in a way that looked like a glowing saucer.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Exactly. Same with any sense organ. One way or another it’s materially explainable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Sure, but your current understanding of what is and isn’t materially explainable can be wrong. You might simply not know something about material reality. It might be more complicated than you think. It’s perfectly possible to dismiss something with “fuck off, that’s magic” and later discover it was materially explainable all along.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This leads us to the next problem in psychometaphysics. Even if you’ve successfully decoupled map and territory in your head, the map can still be wrong. How do we fix that?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since at least the Enlightenment, empiricism and the scientific method have been all the rage — and for a good reason: their successes are mind-blowing. So mind-blowing that many people jumped to the conclusion that this is &lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; correct way to interact with the world, and every other method that works only works insofar as it approximates the scientific method. That idea had been destructive and disastrous in every possible sense. Anthropologist James Scott wrote about it in &lt;b&gt;Seeing Like a State&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.seeingstate" class="footref" href="#fn.seeingstate" role="doc-backlink"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; turns out imperfectly rational solutions do not necessarily yield imperfectly optimal outcomes when we’re dealing with complex systems that arose naturally. The scientific method is great, but &lt;a href="https://stephenskolnick.substack.com/p/science-could-use-more-magical-thinking"&gt;it shouldn’t be the only tool in the toolbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In another book, &lt;b&gt;The Secret of Our Success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.secretsuccess" class="footref" href="#fn.secretsuccess" role="doc-backlink"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, James Scott describes how intelligence actually worked for almost our entire evolutionary history and what makes humans so much better at it than animals. Our “secret” is the ability to store and transmit culture, to learn from other people. Only &lt;b&gt;very recently&lt;/b&gt; in our history did “science, facts, and logic” become a better method of knowing than “follow the vibes.” If you &lt;b&gt;limit&lt;/b&gt; your thinking to the achievements of science over the last couple of hundred years, you’re throwing away 99% of your brain’s compute — which is biologically tuned for exactly the opposite of that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
Here’s an example where divination using animal bones or augury actually worked. It looked exactly like magic. To understand how and why it worked, you needed knowledge that was far beyond what people knew for most of history. And that knowledge wasn’t in fundamental physics at all — it was in game theory.&lt;br&gt;
Five hundred years ago, before that theory had been developed, if someone heard that a person was choosing a hunting location by reading a map from animal bones, a past Tweedledee would have said: “There’s no physical connection between animal bones and the optimal hunting spot, this can’t possibly work.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
════════════════════&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;When hunting caribou, Naskapi foragers in Labrador, Canada, had to decide where to go. Common sense might lead one to go where one had success before or to where friends or neighbors recently spotted caribou.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;However, this situation is like [the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pennies"&gt;Matching Pennies game&lt;/a&gt;]. The caribou are mismatchers and the hunters are matchers. That is, hunters want to match the locations of caribou while caribou want to mismatch the hunters, to avoid being shot and eaten. If a hunter shows any bias to return to previous spots, where he or others have seen caribou, then the caribou can benefit (survive better) by avoiding those locations (where they have previously seen humans). Thus, the best hunting strategy requires randomizing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;Can cultural evolution compensate for our cognitive inadequacies? Traditionally, Naskapi hunters decided where to go to hunt using divination and believed that the shoulder bones of caribou could point the way to success. To start the ritual, the shoulder blade was heated over hot coals in a way that caused patterns of cracks and burnt spots to form. This patterning was then read as a kind of map, which was held in a pre-specified orientation. The cracking patterns were (probably) essentially random from the point of view of hunting locations, since the outcomes depended on myriad details about the bone, fire, ambient temperature, and heating process. Thus, these divination rituals may have provided a crude randomizing device that helped hunters avoid their own decision-making biases.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;This is not some obscure, isolated practice, and other cases of divination provide more evidence. In Indonesia, the Kantus of Kalimantan use bird augury to select locations for their agricultural plots. Geographer Michael Dove argues that two factors will cause farmers to make plot placements that are too risky. First, Kantu ecological models contain the Gambler’s Fallacy, and lead them to expect floods to be less likely to occur in a specific location after a big flood in that location (which is not true). Second…Kantus pay attention to others’ success and copy the choices of successful households, meaning that if one of their neighbors has a good yield in an area one year, many other people will want to plant there in the next year. To reduce the risks posed by these cognitive and decision-making biases, Kantu rely on a system of bird augury that effectively randomizes their choices for locating garden plots, which helps them avoid catastrophic crop failures. Divination results depend not only on seeing a particular bird species in a particular location, but also on what type of call the bird makes (one type of call may be favorable, and another unfavorable).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;The patterning of bird augury supports the view that this is a cultural adaptation. The system seems to have evolved and spread throughout this region since the 17th century when rice cultivation was introduced. This makes sense, since it is rice cultivation that is most positively influenced by randomizing garden locations. It’s possible that, with the introduction of rice, a few farmers began to use bird sightings as an indication of favorable garden sites. On-average, over a lifetime, these farmers would do better – be more successful – than farmers who relied on the Gambler’s Fallacy or on copying others’ immediate behavior. Whatever the process, within 400 years, the bird augury system spread throughout the agricultural populations of this Borneo region. Yet, it remains conspicuously missing or underdeveloped among local foraging groups and recent adopters of rice agriculture, as well as among populations in northern Borneo who rely on irrigation. So, bird augury has been systematically spreading in those regions where it’s most adaptive.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I’d say “this shouldn’t work, but the data show results… what the fuck?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You know the data also say religious people are generally happier?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Correlation ≠ causation. Dumb people are more often religious and more often happy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Also, realistically, you wouldn’t even get to the point of collecting data. You’d a priori decide it’s not worth your attention. Just like right now, if I told you my grandma's story that she prayed over her son’s corpse and an angel came down from heaven and resurrected him, you‘d say that she‘s lying or mistaken.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Uh… that would definitely be a phenomenon worth paying attention to. Even without the prayer. People don’t usually come back from the dead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Well, my grandma said it happened. Are you going to drop everything, rethink your entire view of reality, and investigate the claim right now, or are you just going to say “yeah, she’s lying” and never follow up?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: What evidence does she have?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Nothing solid — she just says it happened, and the priest said yeah, it happened.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: The priest is an interested party; we can ignore him. Then yeah, grandma’s either lying or hallucinating.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But hunters could come to you and say “we hunt by reading animal bones and it works, cross my heart,” and you’d dismiss them the exact same way — they're biased parties who are lying and/or mistaken.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Funny how that never works the other way around lol. Especially since it’s not even clear what criteria you’re using to define “dumb.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: For the correlation to be spurious you’d need someone deliberately fudging the data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: And wouldn't “the pattern of cracks on heated bones shows the optimal hunting spot” have looked extraordinary to you if you didn’t already know game theory and randomization?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: One such claim I’d skip. Two would make me raise an eyebrow. Three — I’d start digging.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: What if I told you I practiced chaos magic, invoked Eris for help, and it worked &lt;b&gt;way&lt;/b&gt; stronger than confirmation bias could possibly explain?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I’d say you’ve got schizophrenia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I don’t have schizophrenia, I've been screened for that. But maybe there’s the same kind of mechanism you don’t yet understand, like with the crack randomization? &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Well, it really depends on the &lt;b&gt;how&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;what&lt;/b&gt;. Because working rituals do exist. But most of the time you can distill them down to something pretty concrete and mundane.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But until you have the scientific, experimental, and mathematical tools to do that distillation — is it okay to just use them on mystical grounds for the time being?&lt;br&gt;
“The shaman says the caribou spirits influence the cracks in the bones and it works — I’ll take his word for it, shaman wouldn’t lie” would have &lt;b&gt;actually worked&lt;/b&gt; for those hunters, while the clever skeptic would starve.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I’d just find some guy in a hunting club and test whether the bones actually help or not, with a double blind experiment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Those statistical methods hadn’t been invented back then.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: The way you arbitrarily use data — “I cite them when it suits me, and when it doesn’t I retreat to ‘correlation ≠ causation’ without argument” — kinda shows that, despite your fetishization of the scientific method, you actually start from the prior “believers are dumb” and then work backwards, building justifications for why that’s the case, while shamelessly strawmanning your opponents. Same thing with metaphysics: you first decided metaphysics is garbage, but the moment we dug even a little deep you started making metaphysical claims yourself and went full Aristotle lol.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Metaphysics is only needed for some vague justification of why science as a whole is valid. The &lt;b&gt;real&lt;/b&gt; justification is “because technology*. If you literally can’t prove anything in metaphysics, its usefulness is essentially zero — because you can’t prove anything to anyone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: People were doing scientific inquiry long before the cultural idea of technological progress even existed. Are you aware that in the European Dark Ages they believed the exact opposite — that the peak of civilization had already been reached in antiquity, and ever since then knowledge was being lost and everything was getting worse? Paracelsus named himself that to say he was “better than Celsus,” and people back then roasted him: “Who the hell do you think you are, smarter than Celsus who lived two thousand years ago?!”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: The absence of progress in religion is, by the way, direct proof that culture today is better than back then. Progress apparently isn’t obvious on its own.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But when it &lt;b&gt;wasn’t&lt;/b&gt; obvious, people were still doing scientific inquiry. The justification wasn’t “because technology.” It was often “to better understand God’s creation and thereby glorify Him.” A Tweedledee of that era would have said, “God doesn’t exist, so why bother studying anything?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: If you want to make something that actually works, you have to use the scientific method one way or another.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Yet those hunters were divining with bones on completely non-scientific grounds. Cultural progress based on vague  “our ancestors did it this way and things were fine, don’t ask questions” worked orders of magnitude better back then than any attempt at actual inquiry and analysis.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: And yeah, inquiry and analysis back then were heavily intertwined with metaphysics. A huge amount of early science was inseparable from religion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: People didn’t know genetics or that conceiving a child with your sibling leads to birth defects. But through centuries of vague cultural assimilation, culture simply evolved that rule. They had to justify it with “it’s a sin, God doesn’t like it” to calm down all the Tweedledees, but the real mechanism was “we’ve always done it this way, so keep doing it” — and it worked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: A scientist in a primitive tribe would have found it obvious that the bones work, but &lt;b&gt;how&lt;/b&gt; would have been a mystery. After a ton of research he’d figure out that any bones work and it’s a property of the material, not its origin. At some point he’d probably start testing other bones and notice they point in certain directions more often than not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: After maybe a thousand studies he might have figured it out. Realistically, though, after a hundred studies he’d conclude it’s a waste of time and drop it — exactly like you’re not investing in grandma’s resurrection claim right now. The de facto belief that shamanic magic helps hunting &lt;b&gt;helped&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;worked&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: It’s unlikely he could have run thousands of studies. And btw that would have been fucking irrational. If we’re talking pure utility, running “thousands of studies” would be insanely counterproductive. The payoff would be way lower than “it works — don’t touch it.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: The shaman is pragmatically right, no question. In that one extremely narrow spot he’s right. But in a ton of other places he’s obviously completely wrong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Obvious to whom and why?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You have tons of intuitions and instincts that you didn’t arrive at logically or scientifically — they’re just hard-wired by evolution or assimilated in childhood. Often, to understand &lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt; those intuitions work you need five thousand years more scientific knowledge than you currently have, and without that knowledge you’d conclude they’re useless atavisms, the same way you now treat religion. “It works — don’t touch it” worked better.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: That’s exactly why I consider metaphysics a load of wank. Why rush things? We don’t even remotely have ways to unambiguously check anything there. Just sit down and shut up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: That’s exactly what your techbro-skeptic rhetoric is trying to do — cancel thousands of years of “sit down and shut up,” because to you it’s indistinguishable from magic. And yet out of that exact wank we got a bunch of cool shit like hunting techniques and (looks at notes) mathematics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Hunting technique is just random. And mathematics — what the hell does that have to do with it? It came from geometry, which is very much applied&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Well, &lt;b&gt;now&lt;/b&gt; you know why it works. Back then they didn’t. And right now there’s a lot you don’t know.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I know it’s more reasonable to assume Buddhism is bullshit than not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Why do you think that?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Because if something looks like bullshit, smells like bullshit, and contains metaphysics, it’s probably bullshit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Just like bone divination?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Yep.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Circular logic. “Bullshit because bullshit.” God level argumentation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: In a vacuum, bone divination is most likely bullshit. The fact that it isn’t doesn’t make the shaman a genius. He’s still most likely full of shit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: But he’s useful. As in utility. You're the one who keeps bringing up pragmatic utility&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: Especially since you come along and jerk off over one single example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Then refute it. But the fact that a huge number of “technologies” up to a certain point worked on “it works — awesome” instead of “scientific method” is pretty obvious. Experiments and all that only became popular for utility reasons later.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Want more? I’ll dig up some from the same book right now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
════════════════════&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;In the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more days, when they can then be baked and eaten. Figure 7.1 shows the percentage of cyanogenic content in the liquid, fiber, and starch remaining through each major step in this processing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;Such processing techniques are crucial for living in many parts of Amazonia, where other crops are difficult to cultivate and often unproductive. However, despite their utility, one person would have a difficult time figuring out the detoxification technique. Consider the situation from the point of view of the children and adolescents who are learning the techniques. They would have rarely, if ever, seen anyone get cyanide poisoning, because the techniques work. And even if the processing was ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Most people would have eaten manioc for years with no apparent effects. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, stomach troubles, and vomiting).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;So, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem fine. Since the multistep task of processing manioc is long, arduous, and boring, sticking with it is certainly non-intuitive. Tukanoan women spend about a quarter of their day detoxifying manioc, so this is a costly technique in the short term. Now consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She’d find that with a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;Thus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally opaque—an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;Wait. Maybe I’m wrong about manioc processing. Perhaps it’s actually rather easy to individually figure out the detoxification steps for manioc? Fortunately, history has provided a test case. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese transported manioc from South America to West Africa for the first time. They did not, however, transport the age-old indigenous processing protocols or the underlying commitment to using those techniques. Because it is easy to plant and provides high yields in infertile or drought-prone areas, manioc spread rapidly across Africa and became a staple food for many populations. The processing techniques, however, were not readily or consistently regenerated. Even after hundreds of years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa. Detailed studies of local preparation techniques show that high levels of cyanide often remain and that many individuals carry low levels of cyanide in their blood or urine, which haven’t yet manifested in symptoms. In some places, there’s no processing at all, or sometimes the processing actually increases the cyanogenic content. On the positive side, some African groups have in fact culturally evolved effective processing techniques, but these techniques are spreading only slowly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
════════════════════&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: The rationalists of that era would have poisoned all their children with cyanide.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: For comparison, also bring up the useless/dangerous practices. If every lottery winner’s photo came with pictures of everyone who lost, no one would play the lottery.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Scientific racism 🥰 Phrenology.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: The only “scientific” thing there was the name. Absolute garbage with total statistical fuck-ups.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Hindsight is 20/20.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: Tweedledee, you’re trying to sit on two chairs with one butt. On one hand you elevate utility to the absolute and define everything through usefulness, but the moment someone points out the obvious fact that for a huge chunk of human history non-scientific methods were far more utilitarian, you immediately jump to the other chair and start claiming “you don’t understand, that’s different.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: It was about as obvious as the fact that diluting a substance to micro-doses is bullshit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Ever heard of LSD microdosing?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨Tweedledee&lt;/b&gt;: I’m not denying that in the absence of basic data “it works — don’t touch it” is a good paradigm; I even follow it myself on occasion. But when it’s already blatantly obvious that it’s fucking magical crap and metaphysical garbage — time to drop it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: It becomes “blatantly obvious” to you way earlier than is reasonable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👧Lady-in-Waiting&lt;/b&gt;: And to sum up, in this two-chair sitting you end up making completely absurd claims, and that’s exactly how you arrive at rejecting metaphysics wholesale. It’s pretty obvious that a huge number of original scientific fields started from a sincere desire to “figure out how things work,” not from a desire to produce something practical, or they evolved into pure theory and abstraction along the way, and only much later found practical applications. But you dismiss that. You want the shaman to simultaneously stop bullshitting and start investigating when it’s “time,” yet also keep bullshitting and follow “who the fuck knows but it works” when it’s “time,” even though in reality you’re drawing the line between those two retroactively from the height of modern knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: My opinion has become more open to paying attention to all sorts of bullshit. But building a moral system on it still seems stupid to me. Starting from humanism and then seeing what increases happiness in the system without decreasing happiness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Stats show that religious people are happier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: But on a regional level they live worse. Even in countries of the Global North.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: So, for you to be happy, you need to live in a low-religiosity society like the Netherlands, but be religious yourself?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: That only works as long as the population's religiosity level doesn't start degrading the standard of living. It's a peculiar kind of selfish luxury.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I suppose that it's not the average religiosity of the population that matters, but the phenomenon of organized religion as a state institution. If you're religious but outside the structure of, say, the Russian Orthodox Church, then it's fine?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: If you're religious and oppose objectively useful things just because your religion says it's forbidden — even if you're not part of organized religion yourself — you're still reducing society's readiness for progress.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The conversation broke off here for a long time; I had successfully defended my point.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The smartest readers have already figured out that the thing I was criticizing is “modernism,” and skepticism toward modernism is “postmodernism.” The word is extremely overloaded these days, but I’m demystifying it.&lt;br&gt;
In this case I had plenty of time to write full-blown academic texts right in the middle of the dialogue, so no accompanying commentary is needed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Let’s just create a Roko’s basilisk that resurrects suiciders and punishes them for it (with some super mundane but soul-crushing method, like the dreariest public-works duty or paying off a fine at a fast-food joint). 😎&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You just invented Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: So peasants working the monastery lands are themselves to blame for being peasants?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: And if they don’t work, something even worse awaits, yeah. That’s one of many reasons I consider the Tibetan branch of Buddhism to be terrifying garbage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Another Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: It’s total garbage, yeah. Though I can’t say for sure whether it’s the religion or just the economic geography.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: I don’t know either. I’m just looking at Tibetans not only through the lens of objective shittiness, but also because some of that criticism splashes onto me as a non-Tibetan Buddhist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: But when I said stuff like that, I got called a narrow-minded materialist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Can you point to the exact moment someone said that? My memory of it is completely different.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: I said religions are popular because they promise good/bad afterlife and promise to teach you how to get/avoid what you need to get/avoid. You and Lady-in-Waiting jumped on me that Buddhism isn’t like that, that the afterlife there is a punishment anyway, and that I’m just a dumb materialist. Then you two took each other by the hand and walked off into postmodernist solipsism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: You still treat all these terms as one monolithic humanities-bubble, without knowing what they actually mean. “Postmodernist solipsism,” seriously? You can ask [REDACTED] — I hate solipsism very explicitly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: I don’t see how that changes anything. Postmodernism — for me (and I don’t know about the academic definition, but apparently it’s similar there too) — is characterized by completely destroying any shared space for discussion by denying the very concept of meaning. Solipsism is good old “nothing exists outside of me.” “I don’t know what shape the Earth is, but I know what I believe because Allah is with me.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Let me try to explain it this way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The aspect of postmodernism you keep railing against in these discussions is literally just the map–territory distinction, only upgraded with one extra insight: maps can be not only of the territory, but also of other maps, and you can compare maps to other maps even without ever touching the territory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The simplest example that should be obvious to a tech guy: you notice that one of two maps is self-contradictory while the other isn’t, so the second one is probably better—even if it’s still full of errors relative to the territory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Everything you say about “solipsism” and “private meaning” and “denying this or that” is just you failing to understand claims of the form “what you’re talking about isn’t a map of the territory, it’s a map of a map” or “this disagreement between two people isn’t actually about how the territory looks, it’s about which map is prettier” or “just because map A corresponds to the territory more accurately doesn’t automatically make it better in practice—it might be extremely inconvenient to use,” etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And you keep jumping from those claims straight to “so you think the territory doesn’t exist and only maps do” or “any map is as good as any other,” which is obviously false and which I explicitly disagree with.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here’s a purely postmodern project that people in the modernist era would have found hard to grasp: you have several different, incomplete, inaccurate, partial, or maliciously doctored maps of a city. You try to cross-reference them, figure out where the inaccuracies come from, and on that basis synthesize a new map that is more complete and accurate than any single one of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Postmodernists say: this work can be valuable and useful for understanding the city, and the person doing it can advance our knowledge of the city even if they never once visit the city and never compare what’s written on the maps with what’s actually out there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tweedledum hears: what city is actually out there doesn’t matter; postmodernists just shuffle maps around and deny the importance of them matching any city.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The main value of postmodernism as a framework today is precisely dealing with media and propaganda. Right now I’m discussing what’s happening in the US, but I’ve never been to the US and never seen Trump in person. Everything I know comes from news articles, YouTube videos, friends’ stories, and other sources—none of which are 100% authoritative, many of which are obviously biased, censored, or straight-up fake. In that situation, when I literally cannot go out and touch the grass, I still have to somehow judge the grass instead of striking the pose “I can’t verify what’s happening in the US, so I’ll be a radical skeptic, deny the importance of talking about it, and just take a big NO position on the entire US.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And that’s the main reason I consider the modernist techbro mindset bad and toxic: without all these mental tools in your head, you’re extremely vulnerable to propaganda and incredibly easy to manipulate. Techbros from Silicon Valley are super good at hard sciences, yet somehow they still often become Nazis and argue for a white ethnostate. Why? Because they have no idea how to handle information in the domain of humanities&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: It’s cool that postmodernism can assemble coherent information from scattered fragments, nice. But I’ve literally never seen constructive use of postmodernism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Why do you get offended by the word “faggot”? I’m just using it in the meaning “man of homosexual orientation.” That’s the definition I’m going with. If you say “but it promotes bigotry against gays,” well, that’s a postmodern idea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: No. It’s not a question of definition. It’s a question of usage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Also a postmodern idea. Some sweet summer modernist like Le Corbusier would object to the idea that usage and definition are different things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: You’re using the word “faggot” to refer to gays — let’s grant that. But everyday people use that word to refer to gays &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; bad people at the same time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Oh, suddenly cultural context and cultural impact matter! Looks like you’re starting to reinvent postmodernism from the very problems it was created to solve.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: What does this have to do with “I’m not a Christian, I just believe in Christ in my special Jordan-Peterson way”? Why does taking cultural context into account suddenly transcend modernism? Was there no culture in modernism? Is all advertising already postmodern? Propaganda too?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Advertising — yes, postmodern. Pelevin’s &lt;b&gt;Generation P&lt;/b&gt; is literally “look how advertisement is pure, unadulterated postmodernism.” Propaganda as a phenomenon existed before (it doesn’t take a genius for a king to tell everyone how great he is), but propaganda as a distinct, studied, systematized phenomenon is a postmodern idea.&lt;br&gt;
What you're telling me right now is kindergarten-level postmodernism, in the same sense that “if you drop a cup it will break” is kindergarten-level physics. Just as there are physics insights that a non-physicist won’t know or understand, there is advanced postmodernism that a non-specialist can’t grasp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Another Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: In modernism, propaganda wasn’t recognized as a valuable idea. Explanations leaned toward universalism — what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Someone got the idea to group certain kinds of communication that previously weren’t seen as special or separate under the term “propaganda.” Building a map of maps, so to speak.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Princess, sorry, but that’s nonsense. Are you seriously saying that any meta-level operations on constructs above the physical level are postmodernism? When the Romans conquer the Greeks and say the Greek pantheon was always part of the Roman pantheon — that’s postmodernism? In general, whenever religions collide and somewhat systematically mutate each other — postmodernism?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Another Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Postmodernism is the recognition of the error of hypostatizing metaconcepts, heh&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.hypostasis" class="footref" href="#fn.hypostasis" role="doc-backlink"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Well, do you think a caveman throwing meat on a fire to cook it is doing thermodynamics and chemistry?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: No, because physics and chemistry are sciences.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Exaaactly. Not every meta-level operation is postmodernism. Roughly speaking: you have base-level physical reality, and you have representations of it and meta-operations — that’s how it was up to and including the modernist era.&lt;br&gt;
Then postmodernism comes along and says: “did you know there can actually be meta-meta operations? And you can stack meta as many times as you want? And you can study the very mechanics of how meta gets layered — a kind of meta-(meta^∞)?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: A student who solves an equation nobody needs just to put it on the shelf is still doing physics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Exactly the same way the Romans conquering the Greeks and declaring the Greek pantheon had always been part of the Roman one isn’t postmodernism. But a student who studies &lt;b&gt;how&lt;/b&gt; that happened and &lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt; it worked — that’s postmodernism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Okay. Not long ago Peterson shat the bed again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: fork found in kitchen&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Why did people call his attempts to obliterate the discussion space and define his own personal unique brand of Christianity postmodernism? He clearly wasn’t doing it on purpose.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: It wasn't about the claim, it was about the framing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here’s a postmodern claim:&lt;br&gt;
Christian theology &lt;b&gt;as a phenomenon&lt;/b&gt; exists independently of God &lt;b&gt;as a phenomenon&lt;/b&gt;. Yes, theology talks about God — it tries to build a map, treating God as the territory. But whether God exists is still debatable, whereas the existence of theology is obvious: you can go to a theology department in a college and film people doing it. Whether it’s useful or not is a separate question, but the point is that religion &lt;b&gt;as a social phenomenon&lt;/b&gt; exists, and you can study it separately from whether the &lt;b&gt;things religion studies&lt;/b&gt; exist or not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ivan the Christian believes in God, Mary the atheist doesn’t, Ahmed the Muslim believes in Allah — yet all three can still work on a joint project: describing why the Caucasus in Russia is Muslim and the center is Orthodox. And they can reach shared conclusions while completely sidestepping the question of whether God, Allah, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I assume you’ll agree with that claim. Next step: we notice there are a gigantic number of varieties of Christianity. You have Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Protestantism, and the village church that believes God literally sits on a cloud and hurls lightning bolts — all as separate phenomena. That doesn’t mean there are multiple gods. It doesn’t even necessarily mean they’re trying to map the &lt;b&gt;same&lt;/b&gt; territory!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For most of history religion had a modernist character: there was an implicit assumption that one single representation of God is correct, and what we’re arguing about is the same kind of thing as arguing about the shape of the Earth; the arguers can be right or wrong about the territory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But then we started noticing that this doesn’t really match how religion works in the real world. [REDACTED] talked about Chinese people who pray to Jesus, Allah, Buddha, and Confucius at the same time and their heads don’t vanish in a puff of logic. You can call them stupid idiots if you want — it's your right — but the fact that it happens is a fact, and you can’t properly process that phenomenon if you can’t at least roughly understand why and how they think.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That’s how the postmodern understanding of religion emerged: it basically consists of phantoms in each individual’s head, and groupings like “Christianity” and “Islam” are only approximate, with no strict objective definition. Like sandwich vs. hot dog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Modernists discussed religion from the standpoint of axioms and theorems. Christians believe in God, honor Jesus, and accept the Bible. Anyone who doesn’t accept all those axioms isn’t a true Christian — they’re some kind of fanfic writer. But reality shows there is no shared set of axioms. If you apply the modernist approach to everyone, literally no one is a true Christian — everyone’s a fanfic writer — and the concept loses all usefulness. You have to form a concept of Christianity that can actually explain the social and psychological phenomena associated with all this activity without breaking when taken to its logical conclusion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now Peterson. Peterson talks a lot about what God means &lt;b&gt;to him&lt;/b&gt; and how God is a phenomenon &lt;b&gt;in his head&lt;/b&gt;. When asked “does God exist?” he can never just say “yes, He does” or “no, He doesn’t” — at best he says “I believe He does” or even “I act as if God exists.” We can never get him to talk about the territory; he only ever talks about maps.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Peterson is speaking from a postmodern framing of Christianity — he discusses it as a map made of phantoms of human mind. A Renaissance theologian wouldn’t have understood a word he was saying. He’d be like “so does God exist or not, motherfucker? I’m asking you about the moon and you’re pointing at your finger.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Whether Peterson is right or wrong is a separate question. Whether he’s doing something useful or just jerking off is also irrelevant. But he is discussing God from a postmodern position, even if he doesn’t realize he’s doing it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Does that make it clearer what is meant?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Peterson works purely with maps, without ever comparing those maps to the territory. He’s doing postmodern analysis. Whether he does it well or badly is a different matter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: By the way, regarding that “we’re talking about religion as a social phenomenon; whether God exists is a separate question.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Saying “whether X or not is a separate question — let’s put it aside and only discuss Y” is, in my opinion, the single most fundamental psychotechnique of postmodernism. And you often interpret this technique as “you don’t care about X / you don’t think X exists / you deny the value of X,” whereas that’s not the point at all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: IMHO “postmodernism” and “modernism” are insanely broad terms, and IMHO you’re don't seem to be using them correctly. 🤔&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Yeah, they’re super broad. They’re entire periods of world philosophy, of course they’re broad.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Another Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Princess is completely spot on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Simp. 😒&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Another Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Speaking as someone with the relevant degree, sorry 🤷‍♂️ I’m ready to simp 24/7 for anyone who actually has academic knowledge, or else the years I've spent studying this shit are wasted &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pawn&lt;/b&gt;: Also, way too much soy coming from Peterson.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;☀️Princess&lt;/b&gt;: Well, for him it’s mostly just a way to keep as many escape routes open as possible: “I never said that / it was taken out of context / watch ten hours of lectures first to get the necessary context before you can criticize me.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;👨🏿Tweedledum&lt;/b&gt;: Okay, fine. That actually makes it clearer. You just showed me literally the first example of constructive postmodernism in my entire life. I’m stunned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org6cd5427" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org6cd5427"&gt;Behold, psychometaphysics!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6cd5427"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, knowing with all this, we return to the original text:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;HERE FOLLOWS SOME PSYCHO-METAPHYSICS.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are not hot for philosophy, best just to skip it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper that is the level of distinction making.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With our concept making apparatus called "mind" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The ideas-about- reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see "reality" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper that is the level of concept.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ORDER is in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the ERISTIC ILLUSION.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reality is the original Rorschach.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#x00ad; &lt;a href="https://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/56.php"&gt;Principia Discordia, p 00056&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We have no direct access to objective reality. We see everything through the lens of our perception, and in the process we inevitably simplify the truth — the entire truth simply won’t fit into our tiny brains. We always look at everything from some perspective.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“Western philosophy” (as the book calls it) or “modernism” (as this post calls it) tries to find one single perspective that will be Capital T True. But that’s impossible. You can’t apply the concepts “true or false” or even “more or less false” to these perspectives — we can’t compare ideas with reality directly, we can only compare ideas with other ideas, or with observations that are themselves also ideas.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Attempts to create one universal perspective for all occasions have always ended — and will always end — badly, because our brains are simply physically incapable of operating in that mode. This is the notorious “hypostatization of metaconcepts,” the Eristic and Aneristic illusions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It’s far better to understand that any way of looking at the world is incomplete and to at least be able to look at it from &lt;b&gt;different&lt;/b&gt; sides.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Discordian “psychometaphysics” is the idea of “looking at things from different sides” on steroids; an especially pumped-up skill of &lt;a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/10261"&gt;thinking a thought without accepting it as truth&lt;/a&gt;; efficient training for joining the &lt;a href="https://drossbucket.com/2018/04/08/the-cognitive-decoupling-elite/"&gt;cognitive decoupling elite&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t give you &lt;b&gt;complete&lt;/b&gt; immunity to blind spots or to inability to understand another person’s point of view — nothing does, we’re all sinners — but I haven’t seen a better philosophy for, at least an honest attempt, than Discordianism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It’s easy to confuse this with the idea that there is no objective reality, only opinions. Personally, I do believe objective reality exists. But I also have no illusions about why I believe that. I receive information from my sense organs and process it with my imperfect brain. Everything I can actually work with &lt;i&gt;in practice&lt;/i&gt; is phantoms in my brain. Even the most rigorous logical deductions are abstractions layered on top of vibes. Eliezer Yudkowsky, when criticizing the idea that there is no reality, defined reality as "&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X3HpE8tMXz4m4w6Rz/the-simple-truth"&gt;the thingy that determines my experimental results&lt;/a&gt;", which is an excellent practical definition, but notice how it is fundamentally subjective (&lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; experimental results).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The notion that somewhere out there, down a million layers of abstraction, beyond my comprehension, there is some “objective reality” is an unverifiable and unfalsifiable hypothesis derived by the same kind of reasoning that once led people to conclude God must necessarily exist as the first cause of all causes. If they were wrong, I can be wrong too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But even if I’m wrong, it’s not a problem — the &lt;i&gt;idea&lt;/i&gt; of “objective reality” is a pretty cool grid, I recommend it. It's almost as cool as Discordianism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The book &lt;i&gt;Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&lt;/i&gt; is dedicated to this theorem and all its implications - of which there are many, but “mathematics does not work” is not one of them. It's one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it to everyone ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This refers to the apocryphal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Bowl_Sutra"&gt;“Blood Bowl Sutra”&lt;/a&gt;, written by some nobody in the 12th–13th century&lt;br&gt;

It‘s an excellent book that changed my worldview a lot, but it‘s dense and academic and it talks about other things, too. If you want a short version, &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/"&gt;read Scott Alexander‘s review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is a much easier read than Seeing Like a State, and I recommend reading it in full. But these &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-the-secret-of-our-success"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; are fine, too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.10" class="footnum" href="#fnr.10" role="doc-backlink"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"&gt;&lt;p class="footpara"&gt;Of course there is — it’s a (not even particularly obscure) psychological technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.hypostasis" class="footnum" href="#fnr.hypostasis" role="doc-backlink"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"&gt;&lt;p class="footpara"&gt;
“The error of hypostatizing metaconcepts” is an explanation of postmodernism like “monads are monoids in the category of endofunctors” — technically correct, but if you can understand this definition, you already understand the phenomenon itself. In simpler words: “treating a made-up abstraction as if it were a real entity.” Homework: go through the post and find examples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.12" class="footnum" href="#fnr.12" role="doc-backlink"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"&gt;&lt;p class="footpara"&gt;Of course I’m not going to edit out things that flatter me just because they don't add anything to the point!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have been provoked into spontaneously analyzing &lt;i&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/i&gt;. I think the idea is sufficiently self-contained and novel to be a post.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Alu: Crime is often romanticized in media. Theft, murder, banditry, piracy, even domestic abuse. Nobody wants to watch underclass social trash, but in culture there is a stable archetype of a successful, independent, conventionally attractive latex-clad hot criminals. Movies, games, amazing stories of their' exploits, even porn.&lt;br&gt;
Alu: And somehow we missed the opportunity to romanticize other crimes — corruption, NDA violation, child slavery, contempt of the court, slander, criminal negligence, suicide propaganda[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;br&gt;
Alu: I can see that those are less universal as far as crimes go, but still, it's an unoccupied niche waiting for someone to create a new art movement out of it&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: The correct answers are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thieves, bandits, and pirates are underdogs vs power, an underdog reader can sympathize; but corruption and slavery are power vs underdogs, nobody cares for that as a protagonist, that only works as an antagonist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theft, assassination, piracy — all take skill, it's charismatic and interesting. Criminal negligence requires you to be an idiot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch &lt;b&gt;Thank you for Smoking&lt;/b&gt; for a unique take on your concept of villainy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a modern criminal movement ever becomes romanticized in media in the future, it's probably ISIS terrorists :D&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alu: It's a good movie, but a rare example. As is corruption, really. There's Gogol's &lt;b&gt;Dead Souls&lt;/b&gt;, but it's just about the only one. Even though it does require skill, and it has way more potential than banditry where beating people up is the entire skill.&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Charisma and competence are the mainstays of a thief's media image, not so much in reality&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: It's possible, but way harder and requires a lot of mastery from the artist. I would have never managed to do it like &lt;b&gt;Thank you for Smoking&lt;/b&gt;. So it's rarer.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Perhaps someone will invent the “secret sauce”&lt;br&gt;
Alu: The more valuable the art&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Do it, then.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Look at Robin Hood. He's not just a bandit, he's a &lt;b&gt;noble&lt;/b&gt; bandit, archer extraordinaire, and the sexiest fox&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Can you invent a sexy and alluring child slaver that the reader can sympathize with?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: BTW, Nabokov is great here. Humbert Humbert is a vile villain, but Nabokov managed to make him sympathetic, because he frames his suffering as being an innocent victim of circumstance and a bossy little girl. And you only realize how absurd his takes are on reflection.&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Terrorism is already romanticized, not any less than piracy or banditry, nothing new here&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: &lt;b&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/b&gt; style terrorism — maybe — but what about real life examples like ISIS? I don't think so. Pirates used to be seen as real villains back in their day. Black Beard managed to become alluring. Could Bin Laden do the same?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Nowadays — well, it would be a dick move because the atrocities are fresh in the memory, and a lot of people lost their family in the attacks. It could only work for shock value.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: The Vietnam War is a trope. Will the war in Ukraine be likewise?&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Somebody will make it, if not already. The pirates in media have jack shit to do with real pirates&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Find some, then. Inauthentic but nevertheless real terrorists and real events in fiction.&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Romanticized ISIS will look nothing like real ISIS&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: &lt;b&gt;Innocence of Muslims&lt;/b&gt; doesn't count&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: And yet, not many would dare make something like that, and even if they do, it will hurt the victims of ISIS&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: In the future — maybe&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Will we have a romanticized story of the Crocus City Hall attack?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: [Ryazan Sugar]([1999 Russian apartment bombings - Wikipedia](&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Russian_apartment_bombings"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Russian_apartment_bombings&lt;/a&gt;) ) as celebrated as the Gunpowder Plot?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: I think not, because by the time it becomes historically relevant, the AI will screw up all the artforms and obviate this discussion&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Well, drug dealers. Fucking &lt;b&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Joker can be seen as romanticizing of terrorism, or maybe of mental illness&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: I would like to see romanticized computer piracy. With hacker aesthetics and Empress vs GForce.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Joker is same as Vendetta, romanticizing terrorism as an idea but not specific terrorists. Vigilantism is, after all, underdog vs power.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: BTW, the recent &lt;b&gt;Joker&lt;/b&gt; with Joaquin Phoenix is a deconstruction, it &lt;b&gt;*de**romanticizes mental illness, showing that it's nothing fun, just pure evil&lt;br&gt;
Alu: It's not hard, given that computer pirates aren't scum that need their image distorted to be alluring. They're fine as they are&lt;br&gt;
Alu: A lot of unrealistic hackers though. *The Matrix&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Yeah, the fight happens in the decompiler window and not in the real world, so not very cinematic. Although wrt this I like &lt;b&gt;Hikaru no Go&lt;/b&gt;, everything is happening on a piece of wood with rocks, and it's awesome&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: I mean, I'm a security expert, I could cook up a &lt;b&gt;Hikaru no Go&lt;/b&gt;-like scenario about computer pirates.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Ah! &lt;b&gt;Imitation Game&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: I didn't watch it, but it's about the dawn of hackers and Turing the Chad&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Who defeated fascism with the power of math&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Oh, I remember romanticized criminal negligience!&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: &lt;b&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: It works because negligence is an actual choice that you need to make to save time for other things&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: And you feel it in the mechanics and the balance&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: A posteriori simple, but highly effective take&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Yes, a genius game&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: “How to make the most boring job in the world super interesting”&lt;br&gt;
Alu: It's more corruption than negligence&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Still awesome though&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Negligence as well. You have to process as much as possible and reach your targets, so you pay less attention to the core of your job, you get punished for it, and it death spirals&lt;br&gt;
Alu: It's not romanticization, it's pure need. You look like a victim of circumstances, not like a person who has it under control and does crimes in service of a higher goal or just for funsies and bragging rights&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: You do crimes because you want to do something more than stamping paper, you have other goals there. And you risk the system's wrath, and you play tricks on it to do “the right thing”. And in the ability to slide along that precipice, not wasting your time manning the death machine, but also not getting murdered by it — is a kind of competence that makes the mechanical challenge of the game&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Quite a genius take really&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: And underdog, not even cool like Robin Hood, but still doing his small part in bringing down the system&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: You are a victim of circumstances, yes. But to do your small good deed of the day from the position of a helpless victim — &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; competence, &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; romance, &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; charisma&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: And the fact that nobody can pat you on the back for it is also important&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: We all think that out heroism will be repaid with everybody praising you for it&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: But doing good, knowing that the world will forget you in five minutes, that nobody would even know you did something — is a kind of moral strength&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: It carries the world&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Nobody thinks that. It's just &lt;b&gt;the viewer&lt;/b&gt; must adore the hero. Romanticizing crime like in Robin Hood is a power fantasy&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Well, &lt;b&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/b&gt; shows up how to have our cake and eat it too. Negligence isn't a power fantasy, it's the opposite of power. But! It's a &lt;b&gt;moral fantasy&lt;/b&gt;, if you could say that. You don't need to be Superman to do good. You can strive to overcome your own weakness and patheticness just as you can overcome the system. The game shows that even if the player thinks of himself as of pathetic scum and not Robin Hood, it doesn't mean that his life is pointless just because it's not dramatic. You do your part. After ten thousands of yous the system will collapse. Nobody will remember you, but do you need to be remembered, or do you need to bring down the system?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: I always liked the moral image of Superman, but, like. I'm not Superman. But it doesn't mean I should give up and sink. I can still do my small part.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: I'm a weak person. Not particularly brave, not particularly smart. But if everybody who is not super gave up, the world would be a worse place.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: It is a fantasy. Just outside of the overton window&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but &lt;b&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/b&gt; is like the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: The point of TUS is — the war wasn't won by the heroes, but by the regular soldiers whom nobody remembers by name. You can only salute them collectively.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: &lt;b&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/b&gt; is the civilian version&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Tomb of the Unknown Soldier — does that count as romanticizing war?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have been provoked into spontaneously analyzing &lt;i&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/i&gt;. I think the idea is sufficiently self-contained and novel to be a post.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
———————&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;
Alu: Crime is often romanticized in media. Theft, murder, banditry, piracy, even domestic abuse. Nobody wants to watch underclass social trash, but in culture there is a stable archetype of a successful, independent, conventionally attractive latex-clad hot criminals. Movies, games, amazing stories of their' exploits, even porn.&lt;br&gt;
Alu: And somehow we missed the opportunity to romanticize other crimes — corruption, NDA violation, child slavery, contempt of the court, slander, criminal negligence, suicide propaganda[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;br&gt;
Alu: I can see that those are less universal as far as crimes go, but still, it's an unoccupied niche waiting for someone to create a new art movement out of it&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: The correct answers are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thieves, bandits, and pirates are underdogs vs power, an underdog reader can sympathize; but corruption and slavery are power vs underdogs, nobody cares for that as a protagonist, that only works as an antagonist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theft, assassination, piracy — all take skill, it's charismatic and interesting. Criminal negligence requires you to be an idiot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch &lt;b&gt;Thank you for Smoking&lt;/b&gt; for a unique take on your concept of villainy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a modern criminal movement ever becomes romanticized in media in the future, it's probably ISIS terrorists :D&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alu: It's a good movie, but a rare example. As is corruption, really. There's Gogol's &lt;b&gt;Dead Souls&lt;/b&gt;, but it's just about the only one. Even though it does require skill, and it has way more potential than banditry where beating people up is the entire skill.&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Charisma and competence are the mainstays of a thief's media image, not so much in reality&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: It's possible, but way harder and requires a lot of mastery from the artist. I would have never managed to do it like &lt;b&gt;Thank you for Smoking&lt;/b&gt;. So it's rarer.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Perhaps someone will invent the “secret sauce”&lt;br&gt;
Alu: The more valuable the art&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Do it, then.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Look at Robin Hood. He's not just a bandit, he's a &lt;b&gt;noble&lt;/b&gt; bandit, archer extraordinaire, and the sexiest fox&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Can you invent a sexy and alluring child slaver that the reader can sympathize with?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: BTW, Nabokov is great here. Humbert Humbert is a vile villain, but Nabokov managed to make him sympathetic, because he frames his suffering as being an innocent victim of circumstance and a bossy little girl. And you only realize how absurd his takes are on reflection.&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Terrorism is already romanticized, not any less than piracy or banditry, nothing new here&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: &lt;b&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/b&gt; style terrorism — maybe — but what about real life examples like ISIS? I don't think so. Pirates used to be seen as real villains back in their day. Black Beard managed to become alluring. Could Bin Laden do the same?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Nowadays — well, it would be a dick move because the atrocities are fresh in the memory, and a lot of people lost their family in the attacks. It could only work for shock value.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: The Vietnam War is a trope. Will the war in Ukraine be likewise?&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Somebody will make it, if not already. The pirates in media have jack shit to do with real pirates&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Find some, then. Inauthentic but nevertheless real terrorists and real events in fiction.&lt;br&gt;
Alu: Romanticized ISIS will look nothing like real ISIS&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: &lt;b&gt;Innocence of Muslims&lt;/b&gt; doesn't count&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: And yet, not many would dare make something like that, and even if they do, it will hurt the victims of ISIS&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: In the future — maybe&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Will we have a romanticized story of the Crocus City Hall attack?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: [Ryazan Sugar]([1999 Russian apartment bombings - Wikipedia](&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Russian_apartment_bombings"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Russian_apartment_bombings&lt;/a&gt;) ) as celebrated as the Gunpowder Plot?&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: I think not, because by the time it becomes historically relevant, the AI will screw up all the artforms and obviate this discussion&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Well, drug dealers. Fucking &lt;b&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Alu: A lot of unrealistic hackers though. *The Matrix&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Yeah, the fight happens in the decompiler window and not in the real world, so not very cinematic. Although wrt this I like &lt;b&gt;Hikaru no Go&lt;/b&gt;, everything is happening on a piece of wood with rocks, and it's awesome&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: I mean, I'm a security expert, I could cook up a &lt;b&gt;Hikaru no Go&lt;/b&gt;-like scenario about computer pirates.&lt;br&gt;
The Solar Princess: Ah! &lt;b&gt;Imitation Game&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's a well-known philosophical concept known as the Doomsday Argument. Here's Randall Munroe's simple take on it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Humans will go extinct someday. Suppose that, after this happens, aliens somehow revive all humans who have ever lived. They line us up in order of birth and number us from 1 to N. Then they divide us divide them into three groups—the first 5%, the middle 90%, and the last 5%&lt;br&gt;
Now imagine the aliens ask each human (who doesn't know how many people lived after their time), “Which group do you think you're in?”&lt;br&gt;
Most of them probably wouldn't speak English, and those who did would probably have an awful lot of questions of their own. But if for some reason every human answered “I'm in the middle group”, 90% of them will (obviously) be right. This is true no matter how big N is.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, the argument goes, we should assume we're in the middle 90% of humans. Given that there have been a little over 100 billion humans so far, we should be able to assume with 95% probability that N is less than 2.2 trillion humans. If it's not, it means we're assuming we're in 5% of humans—and if all humans made that assumption, most of them would be wrong.&lt;br&gt;
To put it more simply: Out of all people who will ever live, we should probably assume we're somewhere in the middle; after all, most people are.&lt;br&gt;
If our population  &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf"&gt;levels out around 9 billion&lt;/a&gt;, this suggests humans will probably go extinct in about 800 years, and not more than 16,000.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And people don't seem to agree on it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Almost everyone who hears this argument immediately sees something wrong with it.&lt;br&gt;
The problem is, everyone thinks it's wrong for a different reason. And the more they study it, the more they tend to change their minds about what that reason is.&lt;br&gt;
Since it was proposed in 1983, it's been the subject of tons of papers refuting it, and tons of papers refuting  &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; papers. There's no consensus about the answer; it's like the  &lt;a href="http://blog.xkcd.com/2008/09/09/the-goddamn-airplane-on-the-goddamn-treadmill/"&gt;airplane on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt; problem, but worse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But more notable to me is the utter pessimism surrounding the argument. Even its name implies DOOM, that we will all die out and that's bad. We have 800 years left, and it's terrible!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But let's look at it from another direction. The argument says that we are among the last in line (for a certain meaning of “last”). This doesn't mean that we will go extinct after that! We are the last humans who are to be born, doesn't mean we will die in 800 years. The argument is fully compatible with the idea that the last people will live a million years each.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And take note — the Doomsday timer depends on how many people there are in the future. 800 years is for if the current prognoses of Earth population keep being relevant. But the bigger the population grows, the closer is the Doomsday. If the current prognoses were telling us that the population would grow to 20 billion — the day is closer, and the argument is probabilistically stronger. The more people there are in the future, the closer the Doomsday, after which no more people will be born.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, it's an argument towards that nothing much will change for the next 800 years, and then we all die.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, probabilistically, it's a much stronger argument that very soon — not in 800 years, but way sooner — the population will grow abruptly, and then we stop dying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps we should have called it The Singularity Argument?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am sometimes optimistic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This post in a follow-up to &lt;a href="blog/en/identitydisorders.html"&gt;my previous investigation&lt;/a&gt; into identity disorders. You have to read it first.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes one gets “stuck” on a creative/research problem and can't work on it directly. One should then put it in the &lt;a href="https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Thought_Cabinet"&gt;Thought Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; so it can solve itself. One occasionally feeds it random data and lets it ferment. One reads stuff, plays games, talks to people, all as the problem is watching one from the subconscious, absorbing, tugging on the strings, subtly guiding.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Spaces for trans people, neurodivergence, and dissociative disorders overlap a lot. And on the intersection one can find some crazy stuff. I've already seen “therians”/“otherkins” &amp;#x2013; people who believe they were supposed to be of a different species. They experience dysphoria, same as gender, and they can feel phantom “tails” and other body parts that humans normally don't have. To me, at this point, it's not an exotic observation &amp;#x2013; it's just obvious to me that yes, this is how it works. Identity dysphoria can happen with gender, or it can happen with disability or species.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Many of the sufferers also have dissociative identity disorder (DID), and only one “alter” is the animal/disabled. They feel the dysphoria and phantom feelings only when that alter is “fronting”. But there are some “singlets”, whose only identity is an animal. They tend to say that they used to be that animal in their past lives and reincarnated into a human. Given what they feel about themselves, it's an understandable conclusion. Whenever I try to ask them, for how long they had that idea, they always say “since birth” or “since I can remember”, which doesn't cast much light on the etiology of the condition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So when a trans girl on a Discord server admitted she was a &lt;a href="https://mgewiki.moe/index.php/Holstaur"&gt;Holstaur (18+)&lt;/a&gt; otherkin, the problem in my subconscious switched, so to speak, to the front. Even if she seriously believes that she used to be a hentai monster in her past life, surely she can't claim to having known that since &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; monster girls first appeared in the media?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I quickly confirmed that yes, she is serious, she considers herself a reincarnation of a Holstaur, is dysphoric, and can describe her phantom tail. It didn't take a lot of pressure until I got her to admit &amp;#x2013; no, she didn't know that since birth. The realization that she was a Hostaur only hit her when she started feminizing hormone therapy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I distinctly felt a phantom lightbulb over my head.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I assembled three trans women and three trans men with BIID who agreed to share their story. Everything is quoted with permission, but anonymized and shortened.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Specimen A. Trans woman. Officially diagnosed DID. Three personalities, all female, all three have BIID, although they disagree about what parts exactly they want to chop off. The first “schism” ocurred in childhood due to severe trauma, the second one &amp;#x2013; right after strating femizing HRT. She remembers disliking her limbs since before the first schism, but she only realized and admitted actual BIID after starting HRT.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
[T]he first schism occurred as a side effect of, for a lack of a better way to describe it, the mental stress of exorcism ritual practices. One half declared the other a demonic possession and mentally locked her away for years before our wife discovered who she really was. By that point, the stress of suppressing a schism coupled with the mental torture we were enduring at the hands of a man who was literally the joker irl, except he had nature tattoos and he preferred his fists over guns, a second schism event occurred, and by that point, we were experienced with DID and schism events, so our wife identified it quickly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
We may get [an orchiectomy], but it's unlikely as we're leaning towards non op because one of us very much wants to keep everything and the other two of us don't want to put her through losing it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The stress of being misgendered can cause a temporary schism to form, and when you transition and become the person you wanted to be from the beginning, you usually merge with the schism during transition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Our earliest memories of not wanting our arms and feeling uncomfortable with their presence we're at 4 years old. This was years before our first schism event. Our leg BIID developed around the same time as the first schism event. Our wife was the one who finally made us aware of the condition, as we were very deep into denial for a long time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Specimen B. Trans woman. Traumatized in childhood, suspected DID but not confirmed or officially diagnosed. Fear of disability grew into acrotomophilia. She knew about BIID, but used to say that it doesn't describe her, she's just a perv. Transgender realization and social transition went well, but after she started HRT, her BIID fully woke up, and now she's more dysphoric about her limbs than about her gender.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I spent my childhood years very much terrified of disability. I read a magazine issue about how amputees live and I heard of stephen hawking and in school my teacher told me a story about a guy hitting his head and going blind and so on&lt;br&gt;
I was scared that I will be disabled one day, and I thought disability lives to not be worth living&lt;br&gt;
This give me an anxiety disorder and a disability fetish. Funny that&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Amputee hentai was my escape [from] reality, I got really into it. I heard of BID but I always thought that I'm just a perv&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I realized I was trans because I was always making myself the woman in my sex fantasies. And as a woman I was also disabled most of the time, but I didn't realize the same about BID until I got on hormones and reexamined my dysphoria&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I got worse on hormones, really. I realized I need to be a quad, and my quad dysphoria is so so so so much harder to deal with than gender dysphoria&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Specimen C. Trans woman. Used to always be curious about amputees, partially as an acrotimophile, partially as morbid curiousity. She knew she was trans since she was a teen, but only started HRT much later. Soon after that she encountered a pornographic drawing of a limbless girl and realized that she wants to be like that. She fought those feelings for a long time, but ended up admitting her BIID.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I remember sharing a picture of a quad girl I thought was really beautiful. When I said “This is my ideal body, this is who I really am on the inside.” I felt a sensation akin to when one discovers their gender identity. It was intense, and it was very pleasant. It felt like I had found out something deep about myself&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
But truth be told, I always thought amputees were&amp;#x2026; curious, I had a morbid interest in them&lt;br&gt;
Not strong enough to seek them out, but whenever I saw them, I'd turn my head and kind of stare&lt;br&gt;
There was this woman that lives nearby, she is a triple amputee&lt;br&gt;
And she caught my eye, going through the street with a powered wheelchair&lt;br&gt;
I liked DBE/DBK too, and that was exclusively through NSFW content&lt;br&gt;
Moving into DSD/DHD was almost entirely aesthetic preference&lt;br&gt;
And at some other points, I pondered just going DAK&lt;br&gt;
Because it feels like a compromise&lt;br&gt;
But after getting to know what BIID was, that's when it solidified in my mind that I wanted DSD/DHD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(“DBE/DBK/DSD/DHD/DAK” refer to different kinds of amputations)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Specimen X. Trans man. Asexual, but curious about disabilities. Used to read about them on the internet and “playing disabilities” (whatever that means) with other children. After puberty he began feeling extremely uncomfortable about his body, and started experimenting with his gender presentation, leaning masculine. He started masculinizing HRT as a teen, but only realized his BIID much later.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I think i became aware of BID as a concept around the same time as i found out about transness. I was very online at the time and already quite interested in disability related topics. I didn't apply the label to myself though since I was like terminally unaware of my own feelings for the most part but I did tend to give characters in my daydreams the disabilities I was dysphoric about. I also played “disabilities” a lot as a kid with one or two friends who seemed to be into it too. Covid lockdown was when i initially started thinking that i might actually have BID but i was trying to repress it really hard. I didn't think I was upset enough about my body for that but I kept thinking about it. Kind of funny in hindsight how many people realized they're trans during lockdown but i unlocked a second dysphoria.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
(me): So, around the time that you started HRT, did your sentiment about BIID/disability change? Did the dysphoria become stronger or weaker or in any other way different?&lt;br&gt;
(me): Did the testosterone affect it in any way?&lt;br&gt;
(him): I was still deep in denial about my bid when i started T so i dont quite remember. I was still having my daydream disability stuff. It definitely took a while for things to change but i probably started taking my bid more seriously after my body changed a fair bit due to t since I was less focused on the gender things that were “wrong”. Like not having as many gender dysphoria issues meant i wasn't as distracted from my bid anymore so it got stronger. If you know what i mean?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Specimen Y. Trans man. After puberty, he began feeling shame and discomfort. Started roleplaying guys and realized that he likes being a guy better. His experience with disability was mixed &amp;#x2013; his father was disabled, one of his roleplaying characters used a wheelchair, and he had to use a wheelchair temporarily. Given all that, he associated disability with deep shame. He realized he had DID and BIID at about the same time after a major stressor. Never took HRT.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I was always very feminine, and very &lt;i&gt;girl&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#x2026; until puberty, where everything made me super uncomfortable. Everything about my body felt bad, wrong, shameful&amp;#x2026; even though I was growing up to look like the Disney Princesses and Barbie/Monster High characters I loved. It was confusing&amp;#x2026; and then I started roleplaying as a guy- I didn't say I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; one, but the characters I would rp as were guys. I felt like I was hiding this huge secret, but to have people assume I was a guy was&amp;#x2026; genuinely something that made me happier than happy. And I realized, oh yeah, it's probably because I'm not a woman!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
During my later years (fourteen, fifteen) I met someone else who I would roleplay with, and I showed off my first physically disabled character; they told me that people in wheelchairs freaked them out. I started to associate that with shame, especially since my father was starting to need his cane and wheelchair, and people were mega ableist towards him. And my own physical condition was constantly declining; my first time using a wheelchair (in middle school) was forced on me. It was shameful because I was out of breath; I needed an inhaler, but everyone just told me it was because I was out of shape (read: fat). It was just&amp;#x2026; shame, shame, shame.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, I found out I was plural after a bad breakup; before then, I'd noticed my memory felt physically inaccessible to me- and then someone in my head just &lt;i&gt;forced&lt;/i&gt; memories back onto me and I almost blacked out. In the headspace, it wore an eyepatch- and I started to get the intense need to only have one eye. This was the first time I really noticed my BID. I started carrying an eyepatch in my backpack just to lessen that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I didn't know I was ever really experiencing dysphoria until the euphoria showed me how I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; feel, I suppose; my first time using a wheelchair because I needed to, I felt &lt;i&gt;euphoric&lt;/i&gt;. My first time having hearing difficulty? &lt;i&gt;Euphoric&lt;/i&gt;. My poor vision? &lt;i&gt;Euphoric&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Specimen Z. Trans man. Realized his gender at around 13 years old, after puberty; DID around 14; BIID around 18, started HRT much later. Only one personality in his system has BIID &amp;#x2013; “Ash”. He learned about BIID when he wanted to help Ash understand why he hates his arm so much. After he learned that BIID is a thing, he understood right away that this is what it is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
we had an alter who showed up (Ash) who seemed to be symptom holding BID and he was incredibly distressed by our limb&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
As a child our BID was milder, but over more things (our eye and legs below the knees along with our right hand) but the hand did seem to be the main thing then as we got older the others seemed to fade away, now we occasionally get mild fleeting thoughts but nothing we intend to act on, not like our hand&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Yes after puberty, we were really dissociated and our health mentally and physically did a huge drop once we hit puberty but it had worsened our dysphoria, we were already dressing masc by then and then ended up learning about trans people at 14 after searching why we felt like a boy lolol.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;hr&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Those three stories, plus a lot of random snippets from people who didn't give permission to mention them, show a clear pattern about how identity dysphoria develops with trans people. Trans women take the leap after they start HRT; puberty doesn't change anything. Trans men take the leap after puberty; HRT doesn't seem to matter at all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
In other words, identity disorders wake up when your body is flooded with estradiol.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;hr&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
The standard understanding of dissociative disorders is thus. They arise as the result of trauma, usually in childhood. Trying to protect itself from the traumatic experience, your mind attemps to disengage, forget, or replace it with fantasy. If the trauma ocurred early enough, before the child forms a unified identity, we call it DID &amp;#x2013; the personality never condenses into a single identity and stays fragmented and abstracted. Maladaptive daydreaming, sinking into highly realistic and deep fantasies, is one standard way of dissociating from trauma. The content of those fantasies seems to form the underformed identity &amp;#x2013; a lot of DID patients' “alters” take form of the characters from their childhood fantasies, and hold to that identities up to dysphoria.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
It seems natural to assume that identity disorders and dysphoria in “singlets” without DID also happen like that, right? A child forms an identity early in life, and if everything goes normally, he identifies with what he is in real life. But if the child is prone to maladaptive daydreaming &amp;#x2013; including, but not limited to, because of traumatic events in the real life &amp;#x2013; his one identity may form based on what he is in those fantasies. If the child is born a boy, but imagines herself to be a girl &amp;#x2013; the identity will be female, and we call that “transgender”. If the child is, for one reason or another, interested in disabilities &amp;#x2013; he might identify with an invalid, and we would call that BIID. And if he imagined himself a dog, he'd be a dog otherkin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
Would a child who used to read Monster Girl Encyclopedia to escape reality identify with a Holstaur? I didn't manage to find out the Holstaur-girl's age and I can't check what age at the earliest she could have read that. But her Holstaur identity seems to only have formed fully after she started taking HRT. Just like the disabled identity did for a lot of BIID sufferers. Estradiol makes some early signs of an identity disorder “crystallize” into a real identity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
When I started taking estradiol, I faced &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; of suppressed trauma. Memories and feelings that I used to suppress attacked me all at once. 0/10 do not recommend. Apparently, this is the process that makes suppressed identities reappear? Childhood acrotomophilic fantasies become full-blown BIID?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
But here's what's interesing. My spiral into trauma began almost immdediately after I took the estradiol pills. In&amp;#x2026; a few hours? Maybe a day at most? Estradiol is a steroid hormone, it binds mostly to nuclear receptors that regulate DNA expression. Changes in DNA expression can't come up this quickly. Radiation poisoning turns your DNA into mush, but then you wait a week for the first symptoms to appear.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
The local endocrinologists, when asked about rapid effects of HRT on mood, relate them to placebo effect and psychology. You have finally begun your transition, you're happy about it, and that affects you greatly. But that activates my trap card! I initially started taking estradiol in gel form, and yes, I was happy to start my transition, and I expected big changes, but nothing happened. My blood test showed that my estradiol almost didn't change, maybe my skin was too thick to absorb it or something. My endocrinologist changed my prescription to estradiol piils, and after the very first pill, it &lt;i&gt;started&lt;/i&gt;. If this &lt;i&gt;started&lt;/i&gt; was purely placebo, it would have &lt;i&gt;started&lt;/i&gt; when I first applied the gel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
This narrows the search significantly. Estradiol doesn't have that many non-genomic effects. In my last post, I mentioned that estradiol “normalizes” NMDA receptor function, but upon revisiting the papers I learned this from ( &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1582-4934.2004.tb00478.x/pdf"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480182/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458003000125"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) I can see that those are long-term genomic effects. Also, the experiments were done by performing oophorectomy on rats &amp;#x2013; in other words, &lt;i&gt;removing&lt;/i&gt; estradiol and looking at the effects. I tried to take long breaks in my HRT, and nothing happened to my trauma or identity; estradiol woke the demons up, but removing estradiol didn't put them back to sleep. Whatever happened, those are not the droids we're looking for. We are only interested in the one membrane receptor that estradiol works on &amp;#x2013; GPER1.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
What does GPER1 do? Well, a lot of things, as does anything in the human body. This is the moment when I feel handicapped by the fact that I am not a real doctor, but a scrappy amateur. I chased a lot of red herrings here, and there's a lot of things I can't grok, so I am definitely not confident in my investigation or anything.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
But so far the most likely culprit is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis"&gt;HPA axis&lt;/a&gt;. It regulates stress reactions and fight-or-flight reflexes, which is what PTSD is made of. GPER1 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31735968/"&gt;regulates it directly&lt;/a&gt; and rapidly. The interaction between GPER1 and HPA is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6129417/"&gt;modulated&lt;/a&gt; by allopregnanolone. “Modulated” is a wild card term in neuroscience that takes on whatever meaning makes the entire sentence true, but the end result is that allopregnanolone protects the HPA axis from some harmful effects of estradiol. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8197074/"&gt;Chronic stress leads to permanently lowered allopregnanolone levels&lt;/a&gt;, which is sometimes considered a part of PTSD pathology. It doesn't matter much on a testosteronic metabolism, but if you add estradiol to the mix and don't have enough allopregnanolone, the HPA axis is overloaded and, apparently, causes all the suppressed trauma to resurface.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
I even found a comment on Reddit, from a trans girl reporting feeling much worse on estradiol and being fixed by allopregnanolone! Maybe she found the same papers I did?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="org1aebb22"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/identity/estradiol.webp" alt="estradiol.webp" width="500px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, can I cure my PTSD with allopregnanolone and go back to normal? Can one cure &lt;i&gt;BIID&lt;/i&gt; and other identity disorders that bubbled up after HRT with allopregnanolone?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
I can't check. Allopregnanolone isn't over-the-counter and is only administered by IV. I tried to take progesterone, which is supposed to get processed into allopregnanolone, but it didn't help. Maybe I just need to take more of it, eat it by the bottle? I don't know how to calculate the correct dose, I don't know what the side effects might be, and I'm not fully confident this is how it works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
(Also, why do they prescribe progesterone to trans girls only after 1-2 years on estradiol? It's in the clinical recommendations, but I don't know the reason for those)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
In any case, there's a lot more to think about here. If any reader wants to start taking estradiol for the first time, &lt;a href="mailto:inbox@thesolarprincess.site"&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;, we might have experiments to run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had been roped into playing Terraforming Mars. It was one of the worst tabletop games I ever played, and I played Monopoly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The game has no &lt;a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-is-yomi"&gt;yomi&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only thing that makes competitive multiplayer interesting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The players barely interact. They tend to do their own things, trying to get the most victory points out of what they have. They don't particularly care what the other players are doing. There are exceptions like some betting on the commons, but, generally speaking, the advantage you get from knowing what other players are doing and what their plan is is negligible. By the midgame we stopped caring about hiding the cards in our hands – it's not like knowing another player's cards will help you in any way. Compare this to poker, Starcraft, Mafia, or even Rock-Paper-Scissors, where if you can read your opponent's mind you have basically won. And trying to do that is where the fun is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In Terraforming Mars all players are basically playing a single-player game and compete in who does it the best. As a single-player game it's passable; maybe you could make it better by removing all other players.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><link>https://thesolarprincess.site/blog/en/terraformingmars.html</link><author>inbox@thesolarprincess.site</author></item><item><title>Towards less annoying RPGs</title><description>
&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My relationship with the RPG genre is an unending love/hate. I love its core elements. I enjoy roleplaying, exploring, doing side quests, leveling up, immersing myself, freedom of choice, replayability, rich stories and settings, flexible mechanics, dungeon crawling&amp;#x2026; basically, everything normal people love about the genre.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But sometimes developers make very specific design choices that drastically worsen the experience. What I'm going to say now is less of a unambiguous flaw and more a subjective preference — I'm not claiming this approach will work for everyone. I'm just describing what I would find enjoyable and comfortable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(And just to be clear — I'm talking about the CRPG genre specifically. I know that things should work differently in something like X-COM, no need to bring it up)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Inventory. God, inventory. One cannot overstate how much I hate dealing with inventory. Sorting. Selling. Crafting. Choosing equipment. And it's not the concept of inventory that bothers me — it's not the fact that I have to manage gear — it's the technical and UI aspects of just about every single concrete implementation. In retro games it was shit, but it was understandable shit. Modern games have no excuse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most of these problems come from &lt;i&gt;simulationism&lt;/i&gt; — trying to make things work like they do in real life, rather than in a way that's fun, convenient, and balanced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's how I would implement inventory in my dream CRPG game. First I'll go over some general ideas, then move on to more radical modest proposals. I'm going to use &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt; as the canonical example of having done the most wrong things, but, of course, it's not the only game committing the corresponding sins.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orge1c9c87" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orge1c9c87"&gt;Logically Separate Semantically Different Aspects of Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge1c9c87"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why does &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt; store quest items in the inventory? You can't sell them, you can't drop them, and you can't eat them. The fact that they're sitting there alongside metal ingots and soul gems is just annoying; there's no real need for it. Semantically, quest items aren't items — they're markers of quest progression. So they belong in the &lt;i&gt;journal&lt;/i&gt;, not in the inventory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And such it is with everything. We mix together semantically different aspects of the game simply because, on the &lt;i&gt;simulationist&lt;/i&gt; level, they're all basically “items.” We don't dump, say, potions, spells, and perks together, we put them into different panels and subject to different presentation, because they do different things. Likewise, we shouldn't lump potions, weapons, and vendor trash together. Those do even more different things!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Retro games like &lt;i&gt;Arcanum&lt;/i&gt; were especially bad with this — everything literally goes into one grid. Enjoy your inventory Tetris. &lt;i&gt;Dark Messiah of Might and Magic&lt;/i&gt; puts &lt;i&gt;spells&lt;/i&gt; into the inventory, and while there's a UI justification for that, it still leads to some unintuitive moments. Many modern games, at least, allow you to filter by type, but that's not enough — items still follow a unified UI logic regardless of their function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No. Weapons and armor should go under the Equipment tab. Consumables — into the Potion Belt. Ingredients — into the Crafting Pouch. Those should be entirely separate gameplay systems, rather than a single mixed system.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A game that does it right is &lt;i&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/i&gt;. Gear goes in one place, potions in another, ingredients in a third. The process of swapping a hat and the process of drinking a potion use completely different mechanics — and so they should. The fact that other games handle both using the same logic is just a holdover from older design conventions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/i&gt; also shows why this isn't just a minor convenience issue. Look at how it handles crafting ingredients. Throughout the whole game, I had to open my inventory to check my ingredients only once — and that was just to see if it was even possible for the purpose of writing this post. Otherwise, I never needed to. When I'm gathering or buying ingredients, the game shows a pop-up with how many I have. When I go to a crafting station, it tells me what I can make and what I already have. When I need the info, it's there automatically. When I don't, it's out of my way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That drastically reduces cognitive load. I always have a general idea of what I have and what I can craft, and I never need to consciously dig through menus. Compared to something like &lt;i&gt;Divinity: Original Sin&lt;/i&gt;, where being a crafter means spending half the game obsessively scanning menus and peering at icons in a grid — it's incredibly relaxing. I tend to skip crafting in RPGs because of that cognitive friction, but in &lt;i&gt;Hogwarts&lt;/i&gt;, crafting was genuinely fun.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org92ddb99" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org92ddb99"&gt;Segregated Burden Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org92ddb99"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here, I'll use the word “burden” in a broad sense: burden is anything that limits how many items you can stuff into your inventory. It could be based on a literal weight in kilograms, or on a limited number of slots in a grid, or on anything else.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once again, we should separate systems by their mechanical logic. The burden that prevents you from wearing too much heavy armor, the burden that stops you from hoarding potions, and the burden that limits how much loot you can haul out of a dungeon — are all fundamentally different systems. They affect different things and serve different purposes. They shouldn't be lumped together.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In some games, burden is simply superfluous, and removing it wouldn't have made the game worse (e.g. &lt;i&gt;Witcher 1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Planescape: Torment&lt;/i&gt;). In games where you need it, it shouldn't be done via thoughtless simulationism. Developers need to understand exactly what they're trying to limit and what behavior they want to incentivize.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An example of this done right is &lt;i&gt;BioShock&lt;/i&gt;. You have limits on how many medkits you can carry, how much ammo, how much money, how many tonics. But those are different limits! Your ability to carry a limited supply of shotgun shells has nothing to do with how much money you can hoard. And items that aren't consumables at all — like weapons and tonics — don't take up any burden space whatsoever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org05024ce" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org05024ce"&gt;Clearly Indicate an Item's Usefulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org05024ce"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thankfully, modern developers are catching up to this. But not everyone. They all need to hurry up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Arcanum&lt;/i&gt;, figuring out whether an item is useful for crafting, needed for a quest, or can be sold safely is hardly easy. When I played as a technologist, I obsessively hoarded anything that even looked like a crafting component, not having a way to find out if I'd need it later. Eventually, I gave up and looked up all the recipes. It turned out that 80% of it could've been thrown away. My second character was a mage, and I had a much easier time. But then, much later, I found out that some seemingly useless, irreplaceable items were required for the shrines of the gods quest&amp;#x2026; and so I had to run around from vendor to vendor trying to find the one I sold those items to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What we need is simple: every item should clearly indicate what it's used for. What's for crafting, what's for quests, and what's safe to sell should be evident.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org642b3df" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org642b3df"&gt;Shared Party Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org642b3df"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Praise be to Allah, the smartest designers are beginning to figure this out, too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt; had one completely unnecessary system. Companions could carry items, effectively increasing your total capacity. But to make use of this free capacity, you needed to access their inventory directly, playing inventory Tetris, moving items between your backpack and theirs. This was made worse by the horrible UI. &lt;i&gt;The Outer Worlds&lt;/i&gt; handled it better — companions directly increase your carrying capacity, with all items going into one shared pool. No micromanagement required.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And that's how it should be everywhere. The only items that deserve to be “nailed” to a specific character are the ones they actually have equipped. Everything else goes into a shared stash. There is absolutely no reason to make the player decide which party member carries the crafting ingredients and the vendor trash. Those resources exist at the party level, and making players juggle them between individual inventories serves no mechanical purpose. It gets especially bad when your party composition changes, and you're forced to transfer items manually from one character to another. Virgil, you little shit, where did you run off to with all my stuff?! I'll kill you ୧༼ ಠ益ಠ ༽୨&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org7eb0781" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org7eb0781"&gt;Reworking Vendor Trash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7eb0781"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some items serve no purpose other than being sold to a vendor when you get to the town. This is realistic, but at times it's mechanically ridiculous. Take a look at &lt;i&gt;Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines&lt;/i&gt;. There's no burden system in that game at all; your inventory has no limits whatsoever. But vendor trash still exists. The only mechanical difference between a vendor trash item and an equivalent sum in cash is a few extra clicks at the vendor. The only “decision” it introduces is whether you want to sell now or after you level up your Finance skill. But come on, what kind of dumbass lick even levels Finance?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What should happen instead: vendor trash automatically converts to money when picked up. That's it. Loot exists, hassle doesn't.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some games have a vendor trash mechanic that actually adds interesting choices. In &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt;, your tastiest loot is the stuff that weighs little and sells high. That's a solid dynamic, especially since much of the loot in Skyrim isn't &lt;i&gt;purely&lt;/i&gt; vendor trash: armor and weapons looted from enemies also have value. But not every game needs this. In, say, &lt;i&gt;The Witcher&lt;/i&gt; (any of the three), that mechanic is completely superfluous. Designers should consider how this system fits into the rest of the gameplay — if there's no clear, compelling reason to include it, then don't. Don't add it just for the sake of simulationism. Gameplay systems should exist for a reason, and “genre convention” is a weak reason.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A game that gets this right: &lt;i&gt;Dishonored&lt;/i&gt;. Not an RPG, but same principle applies — valuable items exist in the world, but when you pick them up, they just turn into money. Done.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org23539ce" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org23539ce"&gt;Burden Only Makes Sense During Missions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org23539ce"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was elated when I played &lt;i&gt;Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&lt;/i&gt; and saw that burden is completely ignored while you're at the base.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="org8d95f0b"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/rpg/xkcdyears.png" alt="xkcdyears.png" width="100px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope I don't need to elaborate — given everything else, this one's obvious. Having a burden system while dungeon delving? That makes sense and serves a need. Having it while you're in town? Pure simulationism for its own sake, with no gameplay value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org2589cdd" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org2589cdd"&gt;Cosmetics and mechanics are separate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2589cdd"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Time after time, I end up looking like a clown who lost a bet. This happens in RPG games, too — why? Usually because the gear with the best stats doesn't match my aesthetic preferences. Around the time &lt;i&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/i&gt; came out, devs finally began adding the option to hide your helmet without losing its stat bonuses, which is a good first step. But we should go further. Stats and looks should be logically separated. I want to look like a sleek rogue-assassin in leather armor. I don't care that glass armor also counts as light and has better stats — trying to stealth around dressed like a disco ball feels ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="org26c0ce6"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/rpg/peterclown.png" alt="peterclown.png" width="400px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A game that gets this right: &lt;i&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/i&gt;. You can reassign the visuals from piece of gear to another, and some pieces of gear are visual-only. You build up a collection of visuals in a separate tab (not in the inventory!), and you can apply them to any item. I don't have to ruin my character's gender-envy-inducing face with a pair of glasses with eyes popping out on a spring.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Cosmetics doesn't just mean character appearance. In &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt;, any vendor trash can potentially be used to decorate your house, which could be an argument against homogenizing them into cash. But then make decoration into its own separate mechanic! Have the player collect decoration into a catalog and place them around. This is how it works in &lt;i&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/i&gt;, too — the Room of Requirement decorations can be transfigured out of thin air if you've unlocked them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even outside of video games, this idea is catching on. In &lt;i&gt;D&amp;amp;D One&lt;/i&gt;, your familiar's stat block is customizable independently of its physical form. So whether you prefer owls or ravens is a flavor choice — it doesn't restrict your gameplay.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org0ed49c4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org0ed49c4"&gt;Enemy Gear Shouldn't Be Lootable At All&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0ed49c4"&gt;

&lt;figure id="orgaa8c31a"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/rpg/blades.png" alt="blades.png" width="400px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt;, 99% of the weapons and armor you loot from regular enemies are vendor trash, except maybe in the very early game. In practice, your actual gear comes from treasure chests, shops, crafting, or boss loot. The fact that a bandit's leather armor is anything but a pure vendor trash item is a weird holdover. It makes it harder to sort usable and sellable equipment, clutters up your inventory, and just generally adds noise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you want enemies to give you money on death, fine — just have them drop actual money. Leave gear for the actually meaningful rewards — chests, shops, crafting, and bosses.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are exceptions. For example, in &lt;i&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/i&gt;, new weapons don't just replace old weapons, they supplement them. Because weapons break so easily, even a weaker sword from a random enemy can be useful, just as a “trash stick” for mopping up weak mobs without wasting durability on your main. In that kind of system, gear is part equipment, part consumable, so different rules apply.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org3df3728" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org3df3728"&gt;Consumables Should Be Free Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3df3728"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(For simplicity's sake, I'm going to call these “potions,” even if they're technically stimpacks or whatever.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Compare real-time games like &lt;i&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/i&gt;, where you can chug potions during the pause screen with zero hassle, to turn-based games like &lt;i&gt;OMORI&lt;/i&gt;, where using a potion wastes your entire turn. The latter is common in JRPGs, but there's a problem: the real opportunity cost of a potion isn't its price or rarity, it's the turn you just spent. All too often, you should have done something else with your time that doesn't need a potion. So in practice, most potions have an extremely narrow window of usefulness. Anything from the previous tier isn't just less useful — it's fully worthless.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Make drinking potions a free action. Let me drink a whole handful of outdated potions to substitute for one on-tier potion. Let me squeeze a tuft of hair from a mangy mare. Potions should be an investment, you spending a resource to make a fight easier. They should actually make the fight easier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A game that gets it right: &lt;i&gt;West of Loathing.&lt;/i&gt; Even though the game is turn-based, consumables don't eat your turn, which makes an otherwise dead-simple battle system surprisingly strategic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org4c25139" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org4c25139"&gt;Make inventory part of the prep phase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4c25139"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Time to tie everything together into one spicy hot take. This isn't just a UI tweak, it's a full-on rework of the RPG inventory formula. But I think it's worth trying at least once, just to see if it works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I propose offloading the whole inventory loadout process into its own dedicated preparation phase, separate from moment-to-moment play.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You have a base — maybe a literal in-universe hub like in &lt;i&gt;Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&lt;/i&gt;, or a purchasable house in &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt;, or a symbolic location, like &lt;i&gt;Baldur's Gate III&lt;/i&gt; camp. From there, you plan your next expedition. You choose your gear — armor, weapons, etc, which are semantically part of your build, like perks or spells, and not inventory items. Weapons get assigned to fixed slots: say, a sword, a bow, and maybe a third slot for something situational.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Potions should go into a limited but expandable potion belt (maybe its size grows with your Alchemy skill-equivalent). You pack what fits and what makes sense. Going up against fire elementals? Load up on fire resistance. Delving into a dungeon, scouting the wilderness, and infiltrating a mansion would need different loadouts. Once you're geared up, that loadout is locked in. Your build is settled for the mission, and all the junk you pick up during it doesn't interfere and doesn't clutter. You don't need to pause and compare equipment at every sword you find. Anything you loot goes into a separate “loot bag,” which doesn't interact with your live build at all. And things like crafting ingredients? You're only going to use those back at base anyway. Don't make me think about them mid-dungeon. Hide them in a deep menu. Let me enter a flow state, where gear and numbers fade to the background, and it's just me and the encounter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org1e01296" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org1e01296"&gt;Why This Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1e01296"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org76afc30" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org76afc30"&gt;More Build Variety During the Game&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org76afc30"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The prep phase isn't just about picking gear — it's a hub for reshuffling your entire build. Respec your stats, swap spells, hand-pick party members. Suddenly it makes sense to have situational gear, like a holy sword that rends undead but can't scratch a bear.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org96e65ae" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org96e65ae"&gt;Strategic Depth.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org96e65ae"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prepping for each run becomes an actual strategic layer. Pre-scouting and knowing enemy types becomes valuable. &lt;i&gt;The Witcher&lt;/i&gt; tried to flirt with this idea and tell us that the strength of a Witcher is in knowing the enemy, but it doesn't actually pay off on a mechanical level. This system would.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org0f85e54" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org0f85e54"&gt;Reduced Cognitive Load.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0f85e54"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During combat, you think about combat. When it's builds, you think about builds. You don't need to keep context-switching every five seconds. You can enter a proper flow state.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org49ef449" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org49ef449"&gt;Less Disbalance in Resource Economy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org49ef449"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt;, consumable economy collapses very quickly. Either you burn through supplies too fast for them to matter, or you hoard so many that you end the game with a mountain of scrolls and potions you never used. Balancing that so that every possible player is well-paced is basically impossible. But if you can do the math on the resource economy on the per-encounter basis, it becomes much easier and more tractable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org3ab6d56" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org3ab6d56"&gt;Sensible Recovery Mechanics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3ab6d56"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every game mimicking D&amp;amp;D runs into trouble regarding the limits on “long rests.” Having unlimited long rests obviates a lot of challenges, but choosing a balanced way lo limit it is difficult. But if you return to base between missions anyway, boom — perfect place to recharge spell slots. No weird narrative gymnastics required.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org6108c3b" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org6108c3b"&gt;Actually Useful Base Building&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6108c3b"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Houses in &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt; are places where you can store loot and save 10 gold on a tavern. Some people get a kick from walking around from chest to chest inside their giant gold-plated mansion, but I was always fine with the cheapest hovel in Windhelm. Here, bases are more important: they are the places for you to prepare between missions. Just don't get your base-building ideas from &lt;i&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/i&gt;. Please.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgc8e7610" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgc8e7610"&gt;Afterword for people who confuse simulationism with realism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc8e7610"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt; required you to sit down and take a poop soon after you eat, complete with a QTE-based butt-wiping mechanic, that would indeed be closer to physical reality, but it would really hurt the &lt;i&gt;fantasy realism&lt;/i&gt; of a hero from a Scandinavian myth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When muggles talk about AI, transhumanism, brain implants, and similar topics, you would often hear about wireheading.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's the logic behind it. The human brains works roughly as a reinforcement learner (RL), maximizing the reward, taking actions that lead to the biggest number. Right now humans get the most reward from normal good things, like food, music, sex, screams of enemies crushed under your feet, and so on. The system can be hacked — some drugs can directly stimulate the reward system in such a way that a heroin addict doesn't need anything but heroin, because no real-life experience can give them as much reward. In the future, we can do this even better — stimulate the reward center directly and set it to the maximum possible value. This is the purported infinite pleasure, the proverbial ‘rats on heroin' kind of future. If we are talking about an AI, then a sufficiently smart AI can just hack its own reward center and get the maximum possible reward — because why even bother doing anything else?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Humans don't seem too excited about the opportunity to press a button that sends them into endless bliss and ends their story on that. But not many can articulate why. Some bite the bullet and go full solipsist — yes, the only thing that matters is the pleasure I feel inside my own head. Some add epicycles like “yes, I will be happy, but that's bad for some vague reason”. Some explain why hedonism is flawed and the only real purpose is serving their equivalent of God. Some think that it's a point against utilitarianism in general. Some try to rebuild their entire conception of ethics. There is no shortage of takes that try to solve this problem by overcomplicating the philosophy behind it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And they are all wrong!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are no errors in the philosophy. There is an error in the math. And you don't even need a degree to understand it, you just need to have played that ancient game, &lt;i&gt;Creatures&lt;/i&gt;, where the titular creatures' AI works by RL.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
RL-based systems aren't trying to maximize reward, per se. When they decide on their next action, the concept of reward doesn't even come up. Reward only exists on the training step, when it gets computed into behavior, but it does not exist when you execute the behavior. You can think of it like that an RL does things that &lt;i&gt;used to&lt;/i&gt; maximize reward during the training, and not things that will maximize the reward &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In humans, training and execution aren't well-separated and happen simultaneously, but still, at no point does the human brain ask itself “what will maximize my reward”. Right now, I feel no compulsion to stick an electrode in my brain, because this never happened in my life, and my brain didn't train on it. If I do it, the brain will update on that, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; I would want to spend all my life glued to the electrode. This works in reverse, too — people suffering from addiction often keep doing it even if they fully understand that it's no longer pleasurable. The way humans form their desires and behavior follows directly from the math without having to reinvent ethics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And yes, humans aren't pure RLs, and there are different kinds of rewards, and human brain is just generally more complicated than that. But even in this simplest case wireheading doesn't become a good idea. This entire discourse stems from a misunderstanding. Somebody said that RL is “maximizing reward”, which is only partially true. Then someone invents a way to maximize reward very much indeed. And then they ask the tricky question — “the math says that you should want to put an electrode in your brain, why don't you want that?” And people keep searching for ways to alleviate the cognitive dissonance instead of just saying “the math never said that”.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No, maximizing your reward center is not a good idea by any means. If you do that, then instead of all the things that you liked at the training steps — sex, art, knowledge, beauty — you would just keep pressing the button, which is as pointless and unfun as it sounds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And you are totally allowed to care about things outside of your head. You don't need to invent any philosophical justifications for why you care specifically that your loved one survives, and not that you would think they survived. It's the other way around, if someone cares only about his own mental state, you should investigate — why, what happened to his brain?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&amp;#x2014;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With all this SJW-pronoun-twitter-culture-war around trans people, we are forgetting the biological and psychiatric basis of the phenomenon. However much you insist that it's not a disorder, that gender is a social construct, that transgenderness is not defined by dysphoria, etc. — dysphoria exists, it has obvious psychiatric consequences, and there must be a reason for it. DSM-5, the closest thing we have to a medical consensus, keeps awkwardly denying that it's a disorder before bringing up symptoms and treatments. The reason is clear — it needs to say that medical help is good, but stigmatization is bad. Commendable, but it complicates the discourse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, I've never been afraid of being offensive and politically incorrect, and as a trans woman myself, I have the n-word pass, so let's get to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org05bf36d" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org05bf36d"&gt;Derealization and ‘henshin'&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org05bf36d"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The core symptom of gender dysphoria is derealization, the rest is commentary. If you need a full description, &lt;a href="https://zinniajones.medium.com/depersonalization-in-gender-dysphoria-widespread-and-widely-unrecognized-baaac395bcb0"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;, this page is true to my experience.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some notable quotes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A feeling of just  &lt;i&gt;going through the motions in everyday life&lt;/i&gt;, as if you're always reading from a script. Everything always seemed like it was somehow less real than it ought to be. I didn't feel like I was my own person -— I had no sense of myself as someone who could make my own choices and decisions as I wished. I often lacked that internal initiative that wants things and seeks things for no reason other than the fact that you simply want them and that's that. Since I didn't want to do anything, I just did whatever was expected of me and said whatever was expected of me. That was all I ever did. I felt  &lt;i&gt;like an actor, being handed my lines&lt;/i&gt; by someone else, and I didn't know how to be anything other than that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Complete lack of motivation, very discouraged and bleak. Can't care about anything. &amp;#x2026; Can't summon the willpower to ‘be a person' to people, feeling sort of like a wall that provides yes or no answers. Nothing seems important. A feeling of disconnect from myself, as if my mind and body are two separate entities. My day-to-day goals hold no weight in my decision making. &amp;#x2026; Nearly all the time I feel generally apathetic to things, my external reactions are more of a formality than what I actually feel about something. A faint feeling that I'm acting like a person as if it's a social requirement?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In that state, I was a dispassionate observer of my own life. The person who went through the motions wasn't the observer-me. Whenever the acting-me felt any emotions, the observer-me recognized the emotions but didn't feel them herself. Furthermore, the observer-me had complete control over the acting-me in the sense that the observer-me could deliberately detach any part of the mind so that neither of the selves could access it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was never really present in my life. Everything was grey, foggy, and not really there. Nothing really got through to me. Eventually I ended up talking to myself a lot in my head and eventually felt like I was two seperate people.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's almost impossible to explain. But it's so destructive. It's the worst. It stops us dead: it's the dysphoria that comes along and fucks everything, undoes the hard work, undermines our confidence, undermines our identities. It pulls the rug out from under our personal realities. It's actual hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
And here are some testimonies on post-transitioning:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was possible to feel things in all their detail and depth and texture, rather than being limited to either numbness or emotional overload. The skin of separation was gone, and life was a breeze: &lt;i&gt;I was just happy, all day, without constantly intrusive thoughts distracting me and separating me from the world&lt;/i&gt;. I can truly care about everything I choose to work towards, because &lt;i&gt;it matters now&lt;/i&gt;. I'm the normal person I always wanted to be, and I can get on with simply living. Finally, I was a whole human being. Nothing was wrong and nothing was missing anymore. I found what I was looking for, and it gave me back the life that dysphoria had taken from me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last June 14th, I went under anesthesia for 6 hours and woke up with a vulva. It was 7 pm. On a Tuesday. The first text I sent was to my partner. Very simply, it read “I'm alive. I love you, and my brain is just &amp;#x2026; quiet”&lt;br&gt;
I spent 23 years “in transition”. I spent a lot of that time convincing myself that I was okay. That I was okay with my body, okay with my penis, and okay with receiving the type of love I accepted because of those things. But when I woke up, my brain was quiet - and even 14 months later it's hard to put into words, but it was like white noise that I somehow learned to ignore, but when it was gone was really the first time I realized that it had always been there. I just felt &amp;#x2026; different.&lt;br&gt;
Everything is beautiful, and I have not thought about harming myself or have had a bad day since last June 14th. Bottom surgery not only changed my life. Bottom surgery saved my life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'll be two years post-op in three months. I have never been happier. I knew I'd be happier after surgery, but it really took a look backwards afterward to realize how much dysphoria my natal genitals caused me. Now, that dysphoria is GONE. Now, I absolutely cherish who I am. Now, I can just not think about it. Let's be clear: the first few hours awake after surgery were as much pain as I have ever known, but even that never occasioned a single instant of regret. Zero. Zip. Nada. Nihil. The first three months of recovery were memorable for the challenge and a bit of discomfort. Still: ZERO regrets. Given a chance to turn back the clock, I would make the same choice every time, the only difference being that had it been possible to do it sooner, I would have.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
In my case, I got to savor the contrast between two conditions very clearly. Most of my life derealized, about 6 months in more-or-less-real, then back out. And I don't call this “henshin” for nothing — it's two different worlds, two different people, one weak and pathetic and unstable; the other powerful and tenacious and, dare I say, maybe even happy. It's not just “I like this gender better” — those are real and strong psychiatric symptoms that you can't miss, can't ignore, and can't fake. Where do they come from, how could such an ephemeral thing as gender affect a person to the extent many drugs couldn't?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Most hypotheses focus on biological sex. They say that hormonal imbalance in the womb may make sex differentiation go different ways in the body and in the brain. They say some brains work better on testosterone and some work better on estrogens, and compare dysphoria to fueling a car with the wrong type of fuel. I, myself, linked somewhere a video of a biologist explaining structural differences in brain areas that can't be changed hormonally or surgically, and pointing out that in trans people, they correspond to their chosen genders — a literal male brain in female body or vice versa.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Well, they're all wrong, &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vrHRcEDMjZcx5Yfru/i-defy-the-data"&gt;I Defy the Data&lt;/a&gt;. Sex differences are red herrings that have nothing to do with gender dysphoria.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgce06f72" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="orgce06f72"&gt;It just doesn't add up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgce06f72"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While investigating my own ups and downs — what made me feel so much better only to later get so much worse? — I found plenty of inconsistencies in the narrative, none of which are a smoking gun, but when taken together make me notice I am confused.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does dysphoria depend on non-biological factors? Why does dysphoria get stronger from being called the wrong pronouns, wearing the wrong clothes, seeing the wrong face in the mirror, and other purely psychological experiences that have nothing to do with biological sex and everything to do with gender as a social construct?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do so many people have their dysphoria go down so drastically after bottom surgery, even if it doesn't affect anything about hormones or the brain at all? (vaginaplasty does that separately from orchiectomy, so testosterone has nothing to do with this)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genderfluid people exist — some people may feel as different genders at different times. And yes, they can be dysphoric from male presentation today and from female presentation tomorrow. Anatomical brain structures can't change that rapidly, they can't have anything to do with it. What exactly changes in genderfluid brains at that point?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonbinary people exist — some people feel as nether boys nor girls, but something different altogether, or nothing at all. I annoyed every endocrinologist in ping range with the obvious question — if some brains are testosterone-fueled and some are estrogens-fueled, then what are nonbinary brains fueled by? They say that they don't actually know and never thought of that. Splendid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transgenderness correlates with autism and schizophrenia a lot. Much more than you could expect from general factors of things going wrong, like your pregnant mother drinking radium-infused vodka. Autism and schizophrenia are both associated with NMDA receptor disfunction. Dissociatives, a class of drugs that cause derealization, are all NMDA antagonists. Both disorders appear in men more often than women. Estrogens improve NMDA receptor function. Those very estrogens that men have less of than women. And that are part of feminizing hormone therapy. I don't want to look paranoid, but way too many strings on my corkboard converge on NMDA, much more than could be explained by the “female brain in male body” model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb836e88" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="orgb836e88"&gt;The key to the answer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb836e88"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My tastes are&amp;#x2026; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrotomophilia"&gt;unusual&lt;/a&gt;, and they led me to unusual places where I found an unusual disorder — Body Integrity Identity Disorder. Those guys really want to be disabled. &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/686709/Amber-Shuping-BIID-blindness"&gt;Here's a story&lt;/a&gt; of a woman who always dreamed of being blind, successfully blinded herself, and then she was very happy and told everyone how awesome it is to be blind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Over the last year, I made a lot of friends among them. They hide, fear stigma, routinely get banned from social media, and live in their own private spaces, where they share their suffering. And one thing that becomes very obvious very quickly — that it's the same thing as transgenderness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
100% the same. Transgender people with BIID are very common, and they all say that their desire to be, say, a woman, and to be, say, a paraplegic, are the same desire that feels exactly the same. And cisgender people suffering from BIID describe their dysphoria in such a way that I can obviously see how their relationship with disability is the same as my relationship with gender.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Same derealization.&lt;br&gt;
Same fits of dysphoria and euphoria.&lt;br&gt;
Same envy upon seeing the desired traits in other people.&lt;br&gt;
Same trek from denial to acceptance.&lt;br&gt;
Same fantasy scenarios.&lt;br&gt;
Same fixation not only on biology, but also on trappings like wheelchairs.&lt;br&gt;
Same absolute enlightenment when they get what they want.&lt;br&gt;
Same no-regret attitude despite sacrifices and hardships.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
SAME. EXACT. SHIT.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So the question is — should transabled people be allowed to participate in the paralympic games? But first, let's figure out the nature of the connection between transgenderness and BIID.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Same as with transgenderness, people offer organic and neurological explanations. They track it down to deficiencies in the somatosensory cortex, or point out the difference between galvanic skin response below and above the desired line of amputation. They often connect it to the “body map”, saying that phantom limbs are when there is no limb, but the brain expects it to be there, and BIID is the opposite.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
When I interrogate those people more thoroughly, they admit that it only explains amputation disabilities and not, say, sensory disabilities. Same energy as “I don't know how nonbinary brains work”. And while in case of gender there may be a common factor that explains all that away, with BIID there is no way that this disorder has a common organic cause. Because the range of desired disabilities is just too wide.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Amputation. Blindness. Deafness. Paraplegia. Quadriplegia. Mutism. Cerebral palsy. Locked-in syndrome. There are even people who want to stutter! The only thing missing is mental disabilities, but other than that, BIID covers disabilities with completely unrelated etiologies. If they want amputation, okay, reverse phantom limbs. If they want paralysis below waist, maybe there's something with their leg nerves. Deafness? Maybe sensory sensitivities, makes sense with autism. Stuttering&amp;#x2026; eh&amp;#x2026; something something vocal cords. But inventing a new explanation for every new case can only get you so far, after a fifth coincidence you should notice a pattern. Something is going on with the phenomenon of disability regardless of the organic causes of the disability.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org3f41c71" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org3f41c71"&gt;Interlude — a look into BIID&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3f41c71"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The desired disabilities are very specific. If a person needs a below-knee amputation, an above-knee amputation is not an acceptable substitute. They have an “all or nothing” mentality — either that specific disability, or thanks but no thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an equivalent of gender fluid people, who switch between desired disabilities at different times. Every desired disability is itself specific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some try to emulate the required disability — like using a wheelchair even if they don't need it. They say it eases the symptoms a lot, even if temporarily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A wannabe stutterer trained himself to stutter and moved to a new town where nobody recognizes him and he can pretend to stutter involuntarily. He reports being very happy and relieved about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The disorder is fully &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egosyntonic_and_egodystonic"&gt;ego-syntonic&lt;/a&gt;. Just as I want to be a woman, and not get cured of dysphoria to live normally as a man — BIID sufferers want to be disabled and not get rid of BIID and life a normal life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no reports of a person successfully getting the disability and regretting it. Whether nobody ever regrets this, or it's just survivor bias and copium, is unclear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blinding yourself intentionally is way harder than it looks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transgender people are BIID's natural allies, saying that however disabling the condition is, if it causes the same dysphoria, I can understand that you can't live fully without it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some quotes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes I feel like just killing myself instead of dealing with these thoughts. But then I figured I'd rather be deaf than dead. It's such a weird train of thought&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I see overcoming a spinal cord injury as kind of a coming of age or right of passage for me because its like my true life will begin when I become a quadriplegic. I feel like I will be complete living my true life then. I guess to me there's kind of a mystique of living a completely different life in a way that is totally visible to everyone around me.&lt;br&gt;
I love the ways people can use adaptive equipment. I want to be seen driving my wheelchair with a sip and puff controller. I want to learn how to use a computer with a mouth operated mouse or eye control or voice commands. I want to learn how manage and direct the day to day cares of life with quadriplegia like managing pressure relief and pain meds or incontinence management.&lt;br&gt;
I like the idea that people in public will know I'm living a different lifestyle but also that I need these extra things. I want people to see me being hand fed and know that I need to be dressed and bathed by carers.&lt;br&gt;
I also like the idea of the kind of non sexual intimacy that would be with those cares. I can't explain why that's so appealing to me but I dont like sexual touching and would permanently give up any chance at sexual pleasure to need that kind of attention.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me my BIID feels like non stop suffering.&lt;br&gt;
I would consider myself passively suicidal at worst, because there are often times where I feel no will to live, but don't actively pursue taking my own life. I have no hope for living and sometimes wouldn't be bothered if I just died. However I also am greatly afraid of death so that is also likely something else that stops me from doing so. At the same time I don't want to die either, I just see no hope in living most of the time. I bring this up because of the emotional toll my BIID has on me&lt;br&gt;
I mentioned that like what [name redacted] said above that my BIID is a constant and never ending thought that drills into my head that I am not in MY body, the one I should have been born in, that these limbs aren't mine, they are foreign and shouldn't be here &amp;lt;&amp;#x2026;&amp;gt; As well occasionally getting burning or numb feelings in the parts of my limbs that shouldn't be there. That thought rings constantly in my mind, as if someone is playing something over the loudest PA system that constantly echoes to every corner of my brain. I also mentioned above that my brain seeing the physical body I am currently in, or just feeling it or the limbs that shouldn't be here hits an intense panic button and sends my entire being into panic mode, like alarms constantly blaring because something is wrong. Of which my mind's response to that is significantly and intensely heightening my anxiety.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know exactly what I want, but it's not painful to have my arms attached to me and I don't feel like they don't “belong” to me. Just an overwhelming desire to have them gone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org5de6155" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org5de6155"&gt;Back to our transes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5de6155"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a lot of trans people among BIID sufferers. At first I thought that it's because trans people have an easier time to realize that they have BIID. After all, transgenderness is represented way better in the media, it's easy to realize you're trans, and once you identify your old feelings as dysphoria you're five minutes away from also connecting it to disability. But no, it seems like there is an actual comorbidity. BIID sufferers who later realized they were trans are about as common. The math ain't mathing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
And as you probably guessed, there are a lot of autistic people among BIID sufferers. Schizophrenics are less public about it, tend to speak unreliable gibberish when interrogated, and I strongly suspect that if I had schizophrenic tendencies and my new internet friend turned out to be doing research on me, that would be bad for my mental health in some way. So I leave schizophrenics to real psychiatrists and focus on the autism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
It certainly looks like autism drives a lot of the comorbidity. Which way the causality goes is unclear, but it's a fact that autistic people often are trans and have BIID. The autistic brain is fixated on identity — and not on invisible biological factors like hormones, but on visible, functional, and social aspects. For gender, this may be pronouns and genital shape; for disability, this is needing assistance and using wheelchairs. And if this desire is not fulfilled, there is dysphoria — the patient doesn't feel like reality is real and they are a person. As a just-so story, if you are confident that in the depths of your soul you are a girl with no limbs, but in reality you are a boy with a full set, you see the boy as a different person entirely, care less about his well-being, distance from him emotionally, and get derealized. And this has something to do with NMDA receptors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I'll get to receptors and hormones a bit later, now, I want to ask the next obvious question — what other identities can cause this? A quick Google shows that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transracial_(identity)"&gt;transracial&lt;/a&gt; is a thing — a person identifies as a different race. Is it the same kind of thing, do they experience dysphoria? Thankfully, Rachel Dolezal, a trans-black woman, wrote a book about her experience! Sadly, Rachel Dolezal, a trans-black woman, is an incredibly boring and basic writer who could take the life of Julius Ceasar and turn it into droning out minutiae. But after exhausting my country's supply of coffee and reading it, I can say&amp;#x2026;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#x2026;yeah, looks like an identity disorder. It's one data point provided by a frankly not very intelligent person, so it's relatively weak evidence in favor. But if other transracial people lived the same kind of experience, then there can be no organic cause for dysphoria. Race as a social construct is way less consistently grounded in biology than gender or disability. The brain fixates on an identity and wants to play the role. Otherwise it doesn't count.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Identity disorders? Where have I seen that before&amp;#x2026;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org49cbc15" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org49cbc15"&gt;Dissociative identity disorder&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org49cbc15"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes incorrectly known as split personality. A rare disorder, vulnerable to roleplayers and posers, overmythologised, where can I find this&amp;#x2026;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#x2026;jk jk. In my Malkavian Madness Network I found people with this disorder, and I don't mean randoms on Discord servers, but personal friends in the meatspace who have no reason to lie to me. People on the plurality spectrum are more common than it seems, it's just that it's not always obvious and is often concealed. Normal people have connections in the government, police, or organized crime, and I have connections among the mentally ill. I didn't choose this life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I won't go deep into plurality here, maybe I'll write a separate post about what and how I learned. But I a) guarantee that this is not roleplaying but actually how this works b) farmed a lot of anecdata for this investigation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Strong dissociation is horrible, and I genuinely pity the sufferers. My own complaints about derealization, isolation, “reverse solipsism”? Peanuts. On the far end of the spectrum, people basically live in “The Amazing Digital Circus” where everything is made up and nothing means anything. But I found what I looked for. Yes, different alters in one body can have different gender identities, and yes, it very well can be that one identity is dysphoric about the current gender presentation and the other is not. When people talk about how to deal with this disorder and hide it from normies, they often discuss what to do if different alters have different sources of dysphoria. The advice “just say you're gender fluid” works less well than you would expect, and it seems like gender fluidity is on this spectrum, too — there are a lot of people whose way to discovering their plurality went like “I thought I was gender fluid, but it turned out to be way deeper than that”.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
And yes, with strong enough dissociation, new personalities with new genders may appear. Those identities are very powerful phenomena — they can have different personalities, memories (dissociative amnesia), even different psychosomatic illnesses. Often those identities associate themselves with historical or fictional characters, and unlike the classic “guy who thinks he's Napoleon”, those personalities do not harbor a delusion and understand perfectly clearly that they are just a psychological phenomenon.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
What I learned is flatly incompatible with any organic causes. There are no pink and blue brains, any brain can work on either testosterone or estradiol, not having body parts in your schema is either not a thing or is downstream of identity. There is a thing called “identity”, which I will for now define ostensively as “the thing that people with multiple personality disorder have a multiple of”. Whatever those identities are made of, often they include specific social roles — “woman”, “black”, “blind” — and consider them to be fundamental parts of their self-image. If the identity doesn't match reality, there is dysphoria. For most people, their identity either doesn't care or matches reality, which makes it invisible. For some, their identity mismatches who they physically are, and that person is constantly derealized, doesn't consider himself a person, and we call it “identity disorder” — either transgenderness if we're talking about gender, or BIID if we're talking about disability.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org06f497b" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org06f497b"&gt;So what about NMDA?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org06f497b"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our perception works roughly by the Bayes Theorem — combining sensory data with prior hypotheses. Your sensory organs keep sending raw data to your brain (elongated green spot on the table), and your brain combines them with expectations (it's more likely to be a cucumber than a snake). As long as expectations and data more-or-less match, you perceive their common denominator and see a cucumber. If there is mismatch, the brain alerts you about it, brings it up to your attention, and corrects the expectations (wait, it may be a snake after all). &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/12/its-bayes-all-the-way-up/"&gt;Here's Scott Siskind's explanation of this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The prior expectations are relayed through the NMDA system. Hallucinations happen when NMDA receptors signal so hard that sensory data don't matter — the brain wants to see the elephant, it sees the elephant, even if senses say there is none. Extend this logic to every function of the brain, and you get schizophrenia — the patient lives in his own isolated world by his own logic and ignores reality. In the reverse case, when sensory data matter a lot relative to expectations, the brain overfocuses on any new sensory data (my tea tastes a bit different than it used to, I expected something else, this is distracting and annoying). Extend this logic to every function of the brain, and you get autism — the patient is overloaded by all the small details in his environment and burns out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So, this is a bit of an overview for why autism and schizophrenia are both associated with NMDA receptor disfunction. So, what does this have to do with dysphoria?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
NMDA-antagonists cause derealization. Inconsistency between the expected and the actual identity causes derealization. NMDA receptors signal the expectations of sensory data. Hmmmmm&amp;#x2026;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
My hypothesis: this “identity” that we're talking about is exactly your set of low-level priors. The hypothesis about expected sensory data. Somehow your brain can maintain a few independent sets of priors and switch between them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;One brain can host several sets of priors, and those are low-level enough to affect your entire personality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Memory is a big part of what constitutes your expectations about the world, and this is why identities may have different memories&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Expectations about yourself, your body, your social role, etc, are especially potent and difficult to change; I have inklings of why this is the case, but I'll leave that aside for now&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the brain fixates on those expectations — “I am a woman, I should be referred by she/her pronouns, see a feminine face in the mirror, and not feel a penis in my pants”. If the NMDA-receptors are dysfunctional (re: autism or schizophrenia), those expectations might “stick”, become trapped priors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Those expectations are culturally coded because culture forms a lot of our priors. We are used to women wearing dresses and paraplegics rolling in wheelchairs — it's those things that filter sensory evidence, not invisible “hormones”. If we hear a deep voice, turn around, and see a little girl, that would be a violation of expectations and will call attention to itself immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If your priors about yourself don't match reality, the constant, inescapable, un-update-awayable mismatch between data and priors calls your attention 24/7. This is why sufferers are like “that thought rings constantly in my mind, as if someone is playing something over the loudest PA system that constantly echoes to every corner of my brain” and cured are like “my brain is just &amp;#x2026; quiet”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Those constant mismatches mean that NMDA receptors are pretty much always signaling, which either leaves them too overloaded for normal functioning, or physically damages them, or something to that tune. Either way you get the same symptoms as their reduced function — derealization and dissociation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's my current hill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgf49b5c2" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="orgf49b5c2"&gt;Other things&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf49b5c2"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This weakly retrodicts why there seems to be fewer trans men than trans women around. If dysphoria is mediated through NMDA receptors, then people with natally estrogenic metabolism will experience less dysphoria, and would thus be less inclined to come out and transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/15wpwja/how_did_transgender_people_survive_throughout/jx4205v/"&gt;Binary trans identity&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively new phenomenon; in cultures where gender as a social construct was more flexible, dysphoria worked differently. I bet that if we get a culture where gender is like that of Terry Pratchett dwarves, the brain will have nothing to fixate on and gender dysphoria will not exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What else can be an identity? Sexual orientation? Age? Occupation? Religion?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/aug/21/japanese-man-dog-long-haired-collie-suit-toco-in-pictures"&gt;This guy&lt;/a&gt; wanted to be a dog so hard he spent 2kk yen on it. Apparently, this is called &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/zdIqqDz.png"&gt;therian&lt;/a&gt;. Those cases are rare and I have't interviewed them, so normally I would just flatly disbelieve the claims about phantom tails and tentacles and stuff. But if my hypothesis is right, it's not that impossible. If you can make your priors expect a tail you might feel a tail. Needs more research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Could NMDA agonists reduce dysphoria? Maybe, but they seem to be underresearched, and I haven't found anything I can just eat and see what happens. No, glycine supplements won't do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sometimes new alters appear. Sometimes old ones disappear. Sometimes new dissociative identities have nothing to do with the old ones. Cases when it happens plural people themselves describe as NOT FUN DO NOT RECOMMEND PLEASE DON'T. So all the fascist butchers in the audience, take heed — maybe by strategically inflicting severe psychological trauma, you can make trans people to genuinely identify with their birth sex. I am a good person doing good research and I won't be making oppenheimer eyes into the camera in 10 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/"&gt;An opinion has been expressed&lt;/a&gt; that plurality is humanity's natural state, and a single consciousness and identity are adaptations to settled civilizations. After this investigation, I believe this a little more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nothing that has been said makes me less of a woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I fully support legalizing elective surgery for BIID sufferers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I will keep researching and I expect to find a lot of interesting stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a recovering expert in communication protocols, I occasionally try to write what I know.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about one-way functions and storing passwords in hashes, and I got that idea — that you also can use it for primitive “ciphers” like “the tiger is out of the cage”. You can adopt this plot twist into a story or a game if you want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An important NPC asks the players a riddle. The riddle is difficult, contrived, confusing, and overall not very well-designed. The assumption is that the players can't possibly solve it, but if you tell them the answer, they would understand that it's the correct one. The riddle would probably contain a lot of extremely specific conditions that don't send you down any specific trains of thought.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Later, having forgotten about the riddle and not thinking it to be very important, the players meet that NPC again, and they suspect it can be an impostor pretending to be them. The problem is that the impostor can read their thoughts!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Whatever question you think of of the form “what only the real NPC would know”, he would know what answer can satisfy you. If you try to provoke him to do something, he would know what behavior you expect. Whatever method you can think of to tell the real deal from an impostor, he will know exactly what to do to make you decide that he is real. He knows everything you know, can anticipate and avoid any of your traps, he is immune to deception and misdirection. It seems like this is unsolvable — the impostor can fully imitate the original (as far as you know them); whatever idea you have in mind, he can behave exactly like you expect the original to behave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But there is a creative solution for a resourceful protagonist! Just ask him for the answer to the riddle. The original can simply tell it to you, you can verify that the answer is correct, and you would know it's the original. But the impostor doesn't know the answer! He can probe your thoughts for the riddle, but he can't learn the answer, because you don't know it either. He knows what you expect to hear, but he can never know the exact words — it's a one-way function, you can check if the answer is correct, but you can't find the answer. The impostor won't be able to answer the riddle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It would be cool to add ZKP to the mix, so that you can repeat the trick any number of times — otherwise it only works once; if you learn the answer, every further impostor would know it as well. But you can make your players to carry code books with riddles for each other, that would be amazing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your tongue knows what everything tastes like.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Try to look at any object around you —a wall, a plate, a pillow —and imagine what it would feel like to lick it. You will be able to picture its taste and mouthfeel pretty well. They explain it by that infants mostly learn about the world by putting things into their mouths, so that the tongue is the primary source of training sensory data for the brain. I think this is plausible —one of my friends reports that he doesn't have this effect, and he spent the first few years of his life bedridden and immobile due to birth trauma.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The real world has never been particularly real for me, so the next obvious idea is —what about the taste of virtual objects in video games? Plenty of ink has been spilt on arguing about what counts as “realistic” graphics. By now we understand that “like a photo” is a terrible metric, but what metric can be good?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The organoleptic method seems like an objective test. If it's easy for you to clairtaste something in a video game, if you don't need to force your imagination much, then it can only mean that your brain is immersed enough to take the thing for real. You don't need to count polygons and wax poetic about what a realistic Hadouken should look like. You can just directly probe your brain for if it believes that what you are seeing is real.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, different people will feel it differently. But as far as measurement goes, psychometrics is a step up from self-reporting. Let's see what gets &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; brain to believe! And I'm waiting for your reports about your results.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here are some random games at different levels of graphical realism. All tests were conducted either on the game itself, or on a video. Static screenshots don't work that well, and I put them here only as a reference.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org352aec7" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org352aec7"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org352aec7"&gt;

&lt;figure id="orgb75e557"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/taste/skyrim.png" alt="skyrim.png" width="600px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now bad! Everything feels sort of muted, as if shrink-wrapped, but with a bit of focus I can even dip my tongue into the hearty Nordic soup.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
4/5, I believe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgbdf71c3" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgbdf71c3"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbdf71c3"&gt;

&lt;figure id="org407ab89"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/taste/morrowind.png" alt="morrowind.png" width="600px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's pretty curious compared to Skyrim. People, items, weapons —none of it tastes like anything. But for some reason “natural” objects —rocks, trees, foliage —taste much more real than in Skyrim. I can even feel the petrichor when it rains! And the slight taste of rot. Everybody is hyping up nature in Skyrim, but even though it is admittedly pretty, it's evidently too sterile and polished to befuddle my perception. But Morrowind is truly &lt;i&gt;atmospheric&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
2/5 —it's not everything, but it's something!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org5fa4f96" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org5fa4f96"&gt;Baldur's Gate III&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5fa4f96"&gt;

&lt;figure id="orgd31021b"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/taste/baldur.png" alt="baldur.png" width="600px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure id="orgd418bb9"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/taste/astarion.png" alt="astarion.png" width="600px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Alas. During normal gameplay there's too many highlights, special effects and other zen-disrupting bells and whistles for me to feel anything, this picture evokes no more response than Morrowind. During cutscenes, with the camera being closer to the action and everything being clearer - I can at least taste people, even though they're still kind of plasticy. This is where the dynamics are important — BGIII's graphics look better on screenshots, but when I'm actually playing, Skyrim is more believable. And the food is much more delicious in Skyrim than in BGIII!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
2/5 —sorry but no. Detailed doesn't mean realistic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org565cace" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org565cace"&gt;Cuphead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org565cace"&gt;

&lt;figure id="org61b4671"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/taste/cuphead.png" alt="cuphead.png" width="600px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No reaction. Nice art, but no claim to realism and immersion. It doesn't mean the graphics isn't good —it's delightful and stylish —but my brain doesn't take it as real.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
1/5, as expected.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgc226413" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgc226413"&gt;Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc226413"&gt;

&lt;figure id="org3409b57"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/taste/zelda.png" alt="zelda.png" width="600px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
None. Cute, pretty, but the brain isn't fooled, everything is clearly artificial and toy-like. Comparing to Morrowind, it's clear that low-detail graphics that tries to be realistic will get you better immersion than high-res that doesn't even try to look real. Obvious conclusion here is —if you aren't aiming for a realistic art style, there's no good reason to add stuff like cool sunlight shaders and volumetric fog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
1/5, yes, worse than Morrowind, at least that one had tasty pond scum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgcd5470b" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgcd5470b"&gt;Crysis 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcd5470b"&gt;

&lt;figure id="org97c20a5"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/taste/crysis.png" alt="crysis.png" width="600px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Was it Crysis who hyped up how realistic it can be? Let's check it out&amp;#x2026;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the rare case where the static picture is tastier than the dynamic one. Motion blur makes it worse, turning the world into soap. It's hard to find a video where the PC isn't moving around at high speeds, but in those rare moments —yes, I can taste it. The conclusion: there's no reason to make hyper-detailed graphics if the player won't even see it during the most important moments. It will look cool on screenshots, and it might evoke an early wow-effect, but it won't enhance the gaming experience one bit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
3/5, rarely, but yes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgcbc63a3" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgcbc63a3"&gt;Last of Us 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcbc63a3"&gt;

&lt;figure id="org5369e4b"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/taste/lastofus.jpeg" alt="lastofus.jpeg" width="600px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the game that made me believe it the most. I specifically seeked out something that I could rate as 5/5, and this was it. Yes, the mouthfeel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
5/5.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org4ea70f1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org4ea70f1"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4ea70f1"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style is more important than detail. Low-poly and low-res Morrowind got a much richer reaction than polished TOTK, because Morrowind is trying to immerse you, and TOTK is intentionally cartoony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your graphics need to be blurred to be pretty and run on the hardware, then you should probably make it simpler but remove the blur. It would look worse on screenshots but better during gameplay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tamriel cuisine is better than Faerun cuisine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In political theory there is a model, “political compass”, that places political views along two axes: left-right, and authoritarian-libertarian.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="org0c2a244"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/polittop/base.png" alt="base.png" height="300px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And there is a contentious idea, “horseshoe theory”, which says that two extremes on the compass are essentially the same, or, at least, they are equally bad.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="org293c424"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/polittop/horse.png" alt="horse.png" height="300px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The idea is criticized by everyone who knows about it, and overall it is considered more of a dumb meme than a real theory. But it's correct, and I will now prove it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We are trying to prove that the positions on the opposite sides of the compass are equal in&amp;#x2026; different people call it different things, but it doesn't matter for the purposes of the proof, so I'll just call it “cringeness”. Either the cringeness of the views normatively associated with the position, or the average cringiness of its proponents.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Normally, the positions on the compass are represented as a tuple (X,Y) for horizontal and vertical coordinates, but since we are only interested in the positions on the very edge, we can do with one number &amp;#x2013; the azimuth. The direction upwards is 0 degrees, and clockwise is positive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, on this graph, for example, the point in the blue quadrant will have the coordinate of about 30 degrees (slight deviation), and the point in the red quadrant will be about 350 degrees (going almost the entire round trip):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="orgaa5b4d1"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/polittop/proof1.png" alt="proof1.png" height="300px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also assume that cringiness depends on position in a continuous way &amp;#x2013; nearby points are approximately equally cringey; it's not possible to change you opinion by a millionth of a degree and move from maximum cringe to maximum based.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then the graph of cringiness as a function of degree can be drawn on a flat graph, with azimuth on the horizontal line and cringiness on the vertical one, something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="orgb46a855"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/polittop/proof2.png" alt="proof2.png" width="500px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Notice that the point at 0 and the point at 360 have the same cringiness &amp;#x2013; because it's the same position. The graph closes on itself &amp;#x2013; this is important. Just like your cringiness can't change radically when going from 30 to 30.00002, it can't change radically from 359.99999 to 0.000001. After all, we picked an arbitrary direction as our zero.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's take any two opposite points, X and Y:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="orge80fb10"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/polittop/proof3.png" alt="proof3.png" height="300px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What's cringiness of X minus cringiness of Y? If it's zero, then those are the two opposite points on the compass that are equally cringy, the theory is proven. Let's suppose they're not equal, and either positive (X is cringier than Y), or negative (Y is cringier than X).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's rotate our pair of points around the axis:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="org0980be0"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/polittop/proof4.png" alt="proof4.png" height="300px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The difference between cringinesses can likewise be graphed, and it also looks like a continuous line, and after going around the entire 360 degrees, it returns to the same place &amp;#x2013; so, the difference between the cringinesses looks generally the same as the graph of the cringiness of one point.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But what happens halfway, when we rotate our pair of points by 180 degrees?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="org895365c"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/polittop/proof5.png" alt="proof5.png" height="300px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Relative to where we started, X took the place of Y, and Y took the place of X &amp;#x2013; they swapped cringinesses. So if X was cringier than Y to begin with, now it's less cringy. If the difference was positive, now it's negative, and vice versa.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In other words, if we graph the difference between cringinesses on the graph, it will start out positive, then be negative, then positive again (or vice versa).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="org3199ef8"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/polittop/proof6.png" alt="proof6.png" width="500px" align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As you can see, if the graph is one continuous line, and it's sometimes positive and sometimes negative, there must be a point where it's zero. It's called “Intermediate value theorem”, but you can probably see it just fine &amp;#x2013; if you move from negative to positive in a continuous path, you will be at zero at some point.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, as we rotate our pair of points, somewhere along the way there will be an angle at which the difference between cringinesses is zero. Those would be our two opposite, but equally cringy positions of the compass.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, we don't know the exact shape of the graph and we can't say at what exact angle that happens. Maybe far-left is the same as far-right, or maybe top is the same as bottom, or maybe something else. But there will always be an axis relative to which the horseshoe theory is correct.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Notice that for our “cringiness” we can take any sufficiently continuous variable. There are two opposite points that have the same affinity for the free market &amp;#x2013; probably the bottom-left and top-right. There are two opposite points that give you the same quality of life. Two opposite points that are equally religious. That equally support LGBT rights. The proponents of which are the same average height. That are equally valid according to Danny DeVito. If course, those are different sets of points, but in every case there is some place where the compass bends into a horseshoe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ah, topology!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Unsong&lt;/i&gt;, the forces of Hell made a political move of broadcasting to Earth what exactly is going in in Hell. &lt;a href="https://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%99-the-broadcast/"&gt;The chapter where this happens&lt;/a&gt; is covered in military-grade trigger warnings and assurance that you don't need to read it to understand the story. Those trigger warnings weren't enough, the author had to add another layer of “no, I am serious”, and now I am adding yet another layer. As you can probably guess, it's not pretty in Hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Moral philosopher Peter Singer has a cameo in this book. His main point is that people don't do good optimally. He pushes the typical spiel of “effective altruists” — yes, donating money to cure a child from cancer is all fine, but if instead you send the money to Africa in an organized fashion to cure malaria, you will save much more children per marginal dollar, so you should better do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Pros and cons of this approach were analyzed by smarter people than I, and I don't have anything to add here. But unlike Peter Singer in the real world, the Unsong::Singer saw the broadcast. This left enough of an impression that he abandoned everything he had been working on and switched completely to a new idea — that the most important thing anybody could be doing, the deed of such ultimate importance that all good and evil in history, all horrors, all triumphs, are merely a rounding error.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Compared to getting people out of Hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A less popular but still interesting ice breaker — what can be worse, physical or mental pain? What hurts more, lashes of the whip or public humiliation? Jump into the fire or lose your loved one? How do you even compare?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Cluster headaches are also known as suicide headaches. They regularly show up on Reddit under “what is the worst pain you ever experienced”. In particular, women say that labor pain is nothing compared to cluster headaches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="orgf4b2664"&gt;
&lt;img src="../../attachment/images/pain.png" alt="pain.png" width="400px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A long time ago I suffered from regular cluster headaches. Do you want to know my opinion on what pain is worse, physical or mental?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's mental. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can make cluster headaches feel like a slap on the wrist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's possible that I misremember. Of course recent pain will stand out more compared to one that is literally separated from me by a wall of amnesia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It still left quite an impression.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My mother often told me to become a psychiatrist — saying that maybe I can advance the craft and help the suffering. I said, then, that I don't want that because I don't think it's very interesting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But maybe interestingness should have been a rounding error.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><link>https://thesolarprincess.site/blog/en/hell.html</link><author>inbox@thesolarprincess.site</author></item><item><title>Narrative design in Disco Elysium</title><description>
&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Narrative design is not exactly my cup of tea, but I have some thoughts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An RPG's dialogue system by itself limits what kinds of characters and stories you can work with. Let's take &lt;i&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/i&gt;. What can we say about their dialogue system?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harry never acts on his own; his every word and action must be vetoed by the player. Foil: In &lt;i&gt;Witcher III&lt;/i&gt;, the player chooses major dialogue junctions, and in between those Geralt can converse for as long as he wishes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replies that we choose are always “direct speech” — the specific words Harry is to say. Foil: In &lt;i&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/i&gt;, the player chooses the general direction of the reply (“agree to the plan”, “explain the situation”), and the game expands this to a full speech.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no information in the reply that the character knows and the player doesn't. Foil: In &lt;i&gt;Baldur's Gate III&lt;/i&gt;, a possible option might be “[Dwarf] I recognize this rock, it's a bovinomorphic coprolith”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “author's voice” telling us hard facts, and the “character voice” that is filtered through the protagonist's perception are clearly distinct. We learn most things from the latter — the author only speaks of trivialities that can't be misinterpreted. Foil: &lt;i&gt;Planescape: Torment&lt;/i&gt;, where what the hero sees, what he intuits, what he introspects, and what he remembers from behind the veil of amnesia — all of that is just one author-voice block of text.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The game sticks to those axioms, sometimes twisting into logic pretzels in an attempt to not break the rules. Whenever the hero has to know something the player doesn't, the voices in his head tell us both that — and that feels like learning about the world and not like the hero started out with more information than us. In the notorious “I want to have fuck with you” scene, you only get one dialogue option, which seems basically the same as Geralt answering automatically. However, before that, the voices in your head play out a big ceremony about how you lose control of your libido, and apologize in advance for the stupid thing that's about to come out of your mouth. And you still have to explicitly click on the line, so it feels like it was &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; who blurted it out in a brief lapse of self-control. This makes the phrase something between an establishing character moment and a relatable cringe attack that we all remember when we are trying to fall asleep. Foil: Commander Shepard keeps saying things you never intended to, and it's always annoying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's an excellent approach that hits the sweet spot between a purely freeform roleplay and a rigid premade character. Harry is by no means a blank protagonist, it's a specific person with a specific life, specific opinions, specific quirks, and specific skills. And yet he is still an RPG character that can be roleplayed as you want. The player settles down in his head, learns about his story and his demons and his unusual worldview, and yet he is still making the decisions, playing the role. The limits on roleplaying Harry are internally justified and heartfelt. Foil: the limitations on roleplaying Geralt are justified by the authors telling us what kind of person Geralt is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is never this dissonance between how you see the character and what the character does. People critique games like &lt;i&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/i&gt; for “in-head roleplaying” when in the actual game you just get to choose between paragon and renegade. This is not a problem in &lt;i&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/i&gt;. Despite the fact that you literally have to choose between different positions on the political compass!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
People &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSmZcN7AgHQ"&gt;compare Disco Elysium to tabletop RPGs&lt;/a&gt; when they want to explain what they like so much about it, but I think they all miss the point. It's not about replicating the TTRPG experience. In TTRPGs you make your own character and roleplay them however you want, while the DM allows you to do whatever you want. Blank slate, sandbox. In &lt;i&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/i&gt;, this is not how it works. You are given a specific character and told to play as him. But you &lt;i&gt;play&lt;/i&gt; as him, and not just ride along as he does his thing. The character you get to play is, by himself, literary content, an interesting feature of the game that you don't need to invent yourself. But you still maintain the freedom of roleplaying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This best-of-both-worlds solution is what makes Disco Elysium so narratively appealing. People praise the story, of course, but the story is not the point. Just the plot of the game, described as a sequence of events, isn't anything too special. Notice that in this analysis I haven't even said anything about the story yet! It doesn't really matter at this point, what world the game takes place in, who our character is, or what he does. The game's narrative is well-designed at the level of base game mechanics. Of course, you still need good script writers for this to work, but the innovation comes from the narrative designers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
---&amp;#x2013;&amp;#x2014;–&amp;#x2013;&amp;#x2014;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, not every protagonist can be played like that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First off, the obvious: the hero needs to be an amnesiac. Either with a literal amnesia, like in &lt;i&gt;Planescape: Torment&lt;/i&gt;, or an indirect one, like in &lt;i&gt;Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines&lt;/i&gt;. The game needs the player to not know anything about the world in advance, and this is the standard way to do it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And because of that, the setting itself must be new. Planescape, Forgotten Realms, or World of Darkness are all settings that already have a media presence, and many players know a lot about them coming in. Those games can afford having different dialogue branches for different players. Newcomers can ask NPCs about the difference between a Gangrel and a Gargoyle, veterans can just skip. In &lt;i&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/i&gt;, we can't do that. We sit inside Harry's head and observe the inner machinations of his mind in real time, hitching on the ride as we both learn about the setting. If the game ever has a direct sequel, they'd need to either have a different mechanical structure of dialogues, or make it in a different part of the world; otherwise you wouldn't be able to make a game that is playable for both newbies and veterans.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Somewhat less obviously — the hero can't be wordy. Every reply must be short and to the point. Kim can afford vanting about problems in the precinct, Measurehead can rant on his racial theory, Ervart can emit flowery prose about how much he respects people with convictions. But Harry can't explain anything, can't recount, can't pepper his dialogue with superfluous pleasantries or long introductions. Compare Harry's replies in &lt;i&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/i&gt; with The Nameless's replies in &lt;i&gt;Planescape: Torment&lt;/i&gt;. Those characters display radically different levels of directness, quirkiness, and oh-so-randomsness; and the dialogues in both games would lose in quality if you swap them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And the most difficult limitation to work with is that the player can't plan dialogues. We can't prepare a rhetorical trap and catch the opponent lying. We can't strategically reveal information to later use it. We can't subtly guide towards an idea before saying it outright. Harry is fully and fundamentally a vibe-based creature, controlled more by the ancient reptilian brain than by the neocortex. His investigation method is based on perfecting the Discordian art of making locally good decisions and seeing one step forward so well that you never even need to consider the global picture. Interestingly, Kim fully understands this. When the team needs to tell a newly minted widow that her husband died, Kim gives very specific and detailed instructions to Harry about what to say, and if Harry starts veering off the script, Kim subtly pushes him away and seizes the initiative. The fact that the authors managed to make a work of detective fiction under these limitations is astonishing. Harry is a ‘human can opener', manipulator and provocateur, even though he has not a drop of machiavellianism in his blood. And it looks completely natural.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Notice that I still haven't said much about the story)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Knowing all this, I am curious — what would be some equally organic narrative mechanics for the opposite hero archetype? A rational strategist, well-versed in the lore, ready to break into rants. This is not a hypothetical question, by the way. I had a prototype of an RPG that had this kind of protagonist, but it kept not working out. Then I played &lt;i&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/i&gt; and realized what exactly I couldn't get right! There are a lot of subtle minutiae to work on in mere dialogue mechanics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will ponder this puzzle some more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><link>https://thesolarprincess.site/blog/en/disconarrative.html</link><author>inbox@thesolarprincess.site</author></item><item><title>The Amazing Digital Circus and anti-nihilism</title><description>
&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Amazing Digital Circus&lt;/i&gt; is the best existential horror since SpongeBob SquarePants: Season 1, Episode 17 “Rock Bottom”. In particular, I understand the feeling of being “abstracted” very well — I've been on that brink of falling into oblivion, and I can see that the author experienced exactly that, and he conveyed it perfectly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea is cleverly universal — based on this premise you can explore any topics and tropes you want, just by making a game inside the Circus about it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We have another series with the same kitchen sink approach of “anything can happen and any story can be told on this basis”. I mean, of course, &lt;i&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/i&gt;, with its “infinite universes, infinite possibilities” approach.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But the TADC scheme is different in a very important way. It's not nihilistic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Rick and Morty universe is fundamentally empty — everything can happen at any time for any reason, for every Rick who is smart there's another one who is dumb, for every delicious sandwich there is a disgusting one, if we screw up this universe we can go to the next one over, there is no truth, nothing exists on purpose, nothing means anything, let's go and watch TV. When everything is equally possible, nothing remains.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The TADC universe, however, has a truth, a reality check. The Circus is a virtual space where nothing has any meaning and there is nothing left to do but LARP and cope. But, very explicitly, the real world &lt;i&gt;is there&lt;/i&gt;, and the hope &lt;i&gt;is there&lt;/i&gt;, and even if everything around is farcical, there is &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; that is not farcical, something you can hold on to. The heroes are in a virtual world, but the world isn't itself virtual. I am surrounded by NPCs, and I myself am not an NPC. I am on the edge of oblivion, but I have reasons not to fall into it. You can trust nothing, but you have to trust something.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This anchor allows us to contract the real and the fake. An NPC is experiencing a breakdown over learning that he is a mere NPC, Caine's plaything, only there for the decor? This only means something if the players &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;, and the real world &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, and there is something relative to which you are mere. In Rick and Morty, &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; is a plaything, &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is pointless, there is &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; that isn't mere — so the feeling of existential dread is diluted. If nothing you do has a point, you can just find your own meaning, gaze into the Absurd. This might be scary at first, but then? Enjoy life, push your rock up the mountain, or don't, I'm not a cop. In the Circus, though? You keep looking for the point, for the anchor, for the reason. You want to fall into despair and go watch TV? Rick and Morty says — OK, that was always allowed, watching TV isn't fundamentally better or worse than anything else you could do. TADC says — this is but dark before the dawn, don't give up, or else you'd get abstracted, and your friends would cry, because that would be a real, meaningful loss. On the gates of Rick and Morty it says “All hope abandon ye who enter here”. On the gates of TADC it says — “keep hoping, suckers!”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This contrast let me understand where exactly Rick and Morty jumped over the shark. It started adding meaning to the universe. It now has an overarching arc, and the arc has stakes. Rick got an origin story, got a reason, got a goal. Rick lost Diane — and he can't just shrug and get a new one from the next world over. He is trying to enact revenge on Rick Prime, who exists objectively and non-fungibly. At the start of the series the characters fucked up the Earth and just swept it under the rug — but now they come back and bet bitten in the ass by their errors. Rick is no longer gazing into the Absurd.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And yes, people were happy about the fanservice of Rick's origin story and are excited about how the global arc would develop. But also, they notice that the story changed its tone into less zaniness experimentation. I think this is the reason.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hope that TADC won't make this mistake and won't introduce a plot point that ruins the stakes. The fans are playing with theories that maybe one of the main characters is an NPC, or that the real world doesn't even exist and Pomni appeared out of nothing with all her memories last Thursday. Giving us reasons to look for deception? Yes, that's a cornerstone of the genre. Confirming it, even indirectly? Would ruin everything. The best here is to not violate the basic premises of the setting, never reveal anything about the true nature of the Circus, never show the real world, and never give the characters any global goals. Instead, they should just keep pumping interpersonal drama within the established decor. The potential of the idea — covering various plots and themes against the backdrop of existential horror — won't be lost.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><link>https://thesolarprincess.site/blog/en/tadc.html</link><author>inbox@thesolarprincess.site</author></item><item><title>Gale from Baldur’s Gate III should eat a magic item every long rest</title><description>
&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like neither the Gale's arcane hunger system nor the long rest system.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Arcane Hunger is just annoying. First time Gale asked me to eat an item, I was like “sure, no problem, I have some +1 daggers that I don't care about”, and then it turned out that not all magic items are eligible, and I need to sacrifice an actually useful thing. By the next time he came up I prepared a sacrificial bauble, of course, but I was still a bit salty. Nobody likes this aspect of Gale.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The long rest system is numerically at the spot where it doesn't really limit you in any way and you can rest whenever you want. Recently, a redditor posted showing him running out of food, and everyone was like “I didn't know that was even possible”. And I can't blame Larian — balancing this system so that the limit is real but not suffocating is really hard. And I can understand why they'd rather make in inconsequential — if playing the game required obsessively collecting every 1-sup fish head, it'd be supremely annoying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orge3bb565" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orge3bb565"&gt;The Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge3bb565"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Merge those two systems and have them negate each other's downsides.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Gale a non-optional follower. He can't be skipped and he can't be fired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Gale ask for a magic item every long rest, for the entire game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make more (all?) magic items edible. As far as I can see, there are enough magic items in the world that you could comfortably long rest after every fight if you have all of them; if not, then add more edible items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove camp supplies. Now the price of a long rest is one magic item. Don't remove “free” partial rests for advancing the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org788ec16" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org788ec16"&gt;Upsides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org788ec16"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org4c3e272" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org4c3e272"&gt;The long rest limit is now a true strategic limit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4c3e272"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is a limited and known number of magic items in the world, and it's easy for the game designer to assume how many the player will have at any moment. Magic items are more notable and less fungible than foodstuffs, so the price of a long rest feels impactful, but not overwhelming. And if the player wants to rest often and stretch the limit, it will happen &lt;i&gt;gradually&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At first, you sacrifice worthless baubles that have no other purpose to them. When they run out, you have to buy more items from traders; cheap items exist so this isn't much of a problem, but &lt;i&gt;you notice&lt;/i&gt;. And unlike foodstuffs, magic items don't respawn, so you can't farm them forever. At this point you can go the interesting route — explore more, do more quests, search more dungeons so they can find more items, which is what we wanted you to do in the first place. If that's not enough, you might need to lose some potentially useful rings, and then actual gear, and at that point you'd know that you are in danger. And in the worst case scenario, there's three days from running out to game over, so that's still not a complete ban on long rests, you have time to think about how to dig yourself out of the ditch.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org436cc0a" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org436cc0a"&gt;Less upfront frustration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org436cc0a"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nobody likes that one moment when Gale starts asking for items and you need to part with something you like. But in this new system, the first time it happens you can give him a useless bauble that you planned to sell anyway. We can make extra sure that the player has enough worthless +1 daggers by that point in game to have something to give. And in the long run, when the price of a long rest is established as a rule, it won't feel frustrating — for much the same reason why, in World of Warcraft, the system “after the first few hours of playing each day you get a penalty to XP” was met with uproar, and the mathematically equivalent “for the first few hours of playing each day you get a bonus to XP” was accepted with no complaints. That's the rule of the game, a ring for a rest, and if you ever need to part with your favorite weapon, that's your fault and you had been warned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org77e4f4c" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org77e4f4c"&gt;Less frustration at finding useless loot&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org77e4f4c"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I regularly found myself in a sutiation where I complete a difficult quest or infiltrate a treasury or clear a dungeon, and my reward is a magic item&amp;#x2026; that is weaker than anything I have, or just straight up doesn't fit my specific party composition. And I have to sell it for boring gold. In the new system, every new item you find is &lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt; one more long rest you can take. Magic items become a gamewise-limited resource, like a mini version of a Mind Flayer Tadpole, and they are always exciting to find. And if you had to take one long rest to clear a dungeon and you looted two items from it — you would know it paid for itself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org7cd2ed3" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org7cd2ed3"&gt;Faster and smoother feedback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7cd2ed3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the current system, you can take as many rests as you want until you suddenly can't. Running out of food is the only point of feedback you actually get. Imagine how much worse XCOM would be if losing soldiers meant nothing until at the 15th death you suddenly get a game over?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here, you can feel how well you play, by how long you can last between rests. “I just dump useless trash straight into Gale's open mouth”, “I have to spend money to keep going”, “I have to part with a nice but not essential item”, “I have to lose my favorite legendary weapon”, and “I have three days to find something to save myself” are all qualitatively different experiences with different senses of urgency. Phenomenological depth!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org3ea9659" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org3ea9659"&gt;Magic items become mutually fungible with consumables&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3ea9659"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Potions, elixirs, arrows, bombs, and scrolls suffer from the classic RPG problem of “I never use them until the last fight because I might need them in the future”. Now, consumables can be used to save on magic items! If those ten potions let you take on twice as many fights before you had to rest, then you essentially exchanged those potions for a (unique and named!) magic item, which &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; meaningful and makes it worth it to not hoard consumables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org2130235" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org2130235"&gt;Easier to adapt for hardcore difficulty&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2130235"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For Honor Mode difficulty you add the condition “now Gale is more picky and only eats stronger magic items”. Boom, this adds real strategic difficulty when increasing food cost from 40 to 80 didn't.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org2b3c2f1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org2b3c2f1"&gt;Downsides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b3c2f1"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A non-optional companion might sort of violate freedom of choice in this kind of an RPG?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gale is now even more of an omni-important Mary Sue?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mostly-resourceless classes like Rogue might need a comparative nerf?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What do you think?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's keep talking about narrative design and dialogue mechanics. This time we'll take a look at dialogue mechanics of Undertale.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“But, Princess” — nobody objects, — “There are barely any interactive dialogues in Undertale”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Oh ye of little faith.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The basic mechanic is very simple, using the standard visual novel logic. A character speaks — the text gradually types up in the window — the player can press X to skip the typing and show the entire text — if the entire text is on the screen, the player can press X to proceed to the nest statement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But Toby Fox did something I don't hear a lot about when people talk of Undertale — he gave the characters a voice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No, I don't mean the unique chirping sounds for every character. Those exist, yes. But the way the player interacts with the dialogue also has a voice!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When Alphys begins chattering about her favorite anime, Mew Mew Kissy Cute, the logic of the interaction changes. Now whenever you press X during typing, it doesn't show up in entirety, but simply skips. And when the text is completed, it proceeds to the next statement instantly, without waiting for the player. This creates a clear impression that she is chattering without taking a breath, and you can't stop her.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When you press Mettaton's button and turn him to his second form, he says “DID YOU. JUST FLIP. MY SWITCH”. But between those three phrases there is a forced pause — for the first 1-2 seconds you can't skip to the next statement. This gives it noticeable weight — it's not just a single sentence split in three parts, but a menacing robot, barely controlling his indignant fury, gradually turning towards the player.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When Sans in the restaurant edgelords and says “Y O U D B E D E A D W H E R E Y O U S T A N D”, you can't skip this statement at all. You will listen to it. Letter by letter. This feels distinctly as “drastic change of tone”.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you ever replay the game, pay attention to details like that. The dialogues look inert, but in terms of interactivity they are masterfully choreographed. Yes, some of the tone is given my sounds, music, and fonts — but the way the text is presented also affects the rhythm and the speed of speech. Notice that the fans more-or-less agree what voice each character has — even though the game isn't voiced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This, to me, is one of the key aspects to why the characters are so charismatic. Of course, it's not enough on its own — music and sounds design also play a role — but it's the “secret sauce” that makes them so alive, empathetic and memorable. There are plenty of Undertale clones that copy large scale aspects of the design, story, or tropes. But the strength of Undertale is in the details. Talking to the characters, you can &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; the way they talk, but it's almost a ‘hidden' feature that you won't notice consciously, but that will affect you emotionally. It's something that can't be simply told instead of shown, and it's invisible if you watch a video or a stream of the game.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And it's much more powerful than normal voice acting! I'm not trying to say that Toby Fox didn't have enough money to hire voice actors and had to make do. Normal voice acting is not interactive — it doesn't matter how good the actor is, he can at best give you a static audio file. The way Toby “voices” his game is fundamentally interactive, with the game reacting to the player's actions on the scale of seconds. Is the player passively listening? Or skipping? Is he reading it slowly, or quickly? Is it critical info or filler to him? Did he just stop to think? In a normal voiced like those would sound the same; you can't convey the feeling of “I am trying to get her to shut up but she just doesn't listen and keeps chirping”.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Interactivity is the main strength of video games as an artistic medium. But interactivity isn't just “gameplay” or “story branches”. By correctly working out the minute interactions with the player, you can convey something that “static” media never could. Toby Fox managed to create an interactive voice acting — and cheaply!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
His games have a lot of this kind of minutia that are invisible if you just read reviews, but that still transform the experience, maybe later I'll highlight some more of them. And those are the reason why I think he is a genius.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout%3A_Equestria"&gt;Fallout: Equestria&lt;/a&gt; is extremely &lt;i&gt;viscreal&lt;/i&gt;. I don't know how the author does it, but it makes you feel &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. Every time the protagonist is hit, you flinch. Every time the protagonist is scared, you jump in your seat. I don't know how it works. It's like some kind of subtle word magic is at action. As far as I can tell, it doesn't work on everyone — some are immune to the magic — and thus not everybody appreciates this particular aspect of the book's genius. But for me, it definitely worked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nothing exemplifies this better than Littlepip's struggle with addiction. Early in her journey, she finds some Party-time Mint-als (&lt;a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mentats"&gt;mentats&lt;/a&gt;). True to the original games, they gave her a temporary boost in stats, but taking it too much might result in addiction, and your stats will actually be lowered while you're not under the drug's influence.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Initially, she takes the Mint-als occasionally to overcome some hard problems. It's very helpful, so she starts taking them more and more. Then she starts taking them just for fun, when no obstacle was actually present. Eventually she catches herself thinking how she just isn't herself when under the drug's influence, how only the drug makes her feel normal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At some point, her friends stage an intervention and get her to a doctor, who cleans her system of the drug (that's how it works in Fallout). He warns her that while the chemical effects of the drug are gone, the psychological might remain, and that if she ever starts taking the drug again, the addiction might return.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the procedure, Littlepip feels renewed, rejuvenated, remarkably clear-headed and happy. She initially mistakes it for some kind of high, but then she realizes that this is how she normally feels — that's what she was like before she started taking the Mint-als. All this time, she was a sluggish, brain-fogged, weakened, irritated mess, and she only felt a semblance of normality when under effects of the drug.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And I felt all of that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I felt highspirited whenever she took the drug. I felt down and sluggish whenever she was off the drug. Often I caught myself wishing she would take the pill already, and felt relieved when she actually did. I felt the brain fog — the final chapters before she went clean really did feel sluggish and slow, as if my brain wasn't working properly. The writing and the events felt irritating and uncomfortable — until she took the drugs again, that is. And when she went clean — I really did feel like a mountain was lifted off my shoulders. The universe felt beautiful again. My brain got working back up to speed. Only then I realized how slow and miserable I felt throughout the latest chapters — and how it only got worse and worse as Littlepip's addiction worsened. &lt;i&gt;I felt it all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know how well that reflects real-life addiction — I've never been addicted to any drug in my life. But if it works like that in reality, then I totally get what everybody's talking about and how addiction ruins you so thoroughly. If you or anyone you know are addicted, then I'm sorry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some time later Littlepip finds her stash of the drug and ponders whether to throw it away to not risk getting re-addicted, or to keep it in case she ever needs a boost in an emergency. That really felt like a dilemma. Lots of writers set up contrived moral dilemmas with one answer clearly marked with author's endorsement — but this one felt genuine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
